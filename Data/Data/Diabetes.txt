AB  - BACKGROUND: Current guidelines recommend insulin alone for in-hospital management
      of diabetes, but growing information suggests that new oral or injectable agents 
      may be as effective and safe. METHODS: Systematic review and meta-analysis with
      evidence from randomized (RCT) and non-randomized (NRS) studies in PubMed, EMBASE
      and LILACS databases up to February 10, 2022, for studies including hospitalized 
      type 2 diabetes patients, comparing dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors (DPP4i),
      sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) and glucagon-like peptide-1
      receptor agonist (GLP1Ra) with insulin alone for glycemic control and safety
      outcomes. Findings 7 RCT and 3 NRTs were included. There were no differences in
      mean blood glucose, measurements within range or rate of hypoglycemia between
      DPP4i and insulin. We found a lower mean glucose for GLP1Ra plus insulin subgroup
      (-16.36 mg/dL, 95% CI -27.31, -5.41; I(2)=0%) with lower incidence of
      hypoglycemia <70 mg/dL with GLP1Ra (RR 0.31, CI 95% 0.14-0.70, I(2)=0%). SGLT2i
      data was limited. Rate of adverse events was similar between treatments.
      CONCLUSION: Our review suggests that inpatient management in the general ward
      with DPP4i and GLP1Ra is as effective and safe as management with insulin. More
      randomized studies are required to support these findings before they could be
      recommended as usual practice.

TI  - Association of ambient fine particulate matter exposure with gestational diabetes
      mellitus and blood glucose levels during pregnancy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies have examined the associations between ambient fine 
      particulate matter (PM2.5) exposure and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).
      However, limited studies explored the relationships between PM2.5 exposure and
      blood glucose levels during pregnancy, especially in highly polluted areas.
      OBJECTIVES: To examine the associations of prenatal ambient PM2.5 exposure with
      GDM and blood glucose levels, and to identify the sensitive exposure windows in a
      highly air-polluted area. METHODS: From July 2016 to October 2017, a birth cohort
      study was conducted in Beijing, China. Participants were interviewed in each
      trimester regarding demographics, lifestyle, living and working environment, and 
      medical conditions. Participant's daily ambient PM2.5 levels from 3m before last 
      menstrual period (LMP) to the third trimester was estimated by a hybrid
      spatiotemporal model. Indoor air quality index was calculated based on
      environmental tobacco smoke, ventilation, cooking, painting, pesticide, and
      herbicide use. Distributed lag non-linear model was applied to explore the
      sensitive weeks of PM2.5 exposure. RESULTS: Of 165 pregnant women, 23 (13.94%)
      developed GDM. After adjusting for potential confounders, PM2.5 exposure during
      the 1st trimester was associated with higher odds of GDM (10mug/m(3) increase:
      OR=1.89, 95% CI: 1.04-3.49). Each 10mug/m(3) increase in PM2.5 during the 2nd
      trimester was associated with 17.70% (2.21-33.20), 15.99% (2.96-29.01), 18.82%
      (4.11-33.52), and 17.10% (3.28-30.92) increase in 1-h, 2-h, Delta1h-fasting (1-h 
      minus fasting), and Delta2h-fasting (2-h minus fasting) blood glucose levels,
      respectively. PM2.5 exposure at 24th-27th weeks after LMP was associated with
      increased GDM risk. We identified sensitive exposure windows of 21st-24th weeks
      for higher 1-h and 2-h blood glucose levels and of 20th-22nd weeks for increased 
      Delta1h-fasting and Delta2h-fasting. CONCLUSIONS: Ambient PM2.5 exposure during
      the second trimester was associated with higher odds of GDM and higher blood
      glucose levels. Avoiding exposure to high air pollution levels during the
      sensitive windows might prevent women from developing GDM.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Collar-button abscesses are deep space infections of the hand. CASE
      PRESENTATION: We present a case of a 66-year-old man who developed an acute
      collar-button abscess of the hand after a concrete bench fell onto the dorsal
      aspect of his hand. The hand abscess was managed successfully with intravenous
      antibiotics and operative intervention. DISCUSSION: While such infections
      comprise a small percentage of hand infections, insufficient or delayed treatment
      results in permanent hand disfiguration and dysfunction. This case highlights an 
      uncommon dorsal-to-volar pattern of hand abscess extension. CONCLUSION: Knowledge
      of the anatomy of the hand is essential to diagnosis and appropriate surgical
      management.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) are metabolites of arachidonic acid 
      that may impact atherosclerosis, and animal experimental studies suggest EETs
      protect cardiac function. Plasma EETs are mostly esterified to phospholipids and 
      part of an active pool. To address the limited information about EETs and CVD in 
      humans, we conducted a prospective study of total plasma EETs (free + esterified)
      and diabetes-related CVD in the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS). METHODS: We
      measured 4 EET species and their metabolites, dihydroxyepoxyeicosatrienoic acids 
      (DHETs), in plasma samples from 892 CHS participants with type 2 diabetes. We
      determined the association of EETs and DHETs with incident myocardial infarction 
      (MI) and ischemic stroke using Cox regression. FINDINGS: During follow-up (median
      7.5 years), we identified 150 MI and 134 ischemic strokes. In primary,
      multivariable analyses, elevated levels of each EET species were associated with 
      non-significant lower risk of incident MI (for example, hazard ratio for 1 SD
      higher 14,15-EET: 0.86, 95% CI: 0.72-1.02; p=0.08). The EETs-MI associations
      became significant in analyses further adjusted for DHETs (hazard ratio for 1 SD 
      higher 14,15-EET adjusted for 14,15-DHET: 0.76, 95% CI: 0.63-0.91; p=0.004).
      Elevated EET levels were associated with higher risk of ischemic stroke in
      primary but not secondary analyses. Three DHET species were associated with
      higher risk of ischemic stroke in all analyses. INTERPRETATION: Findings from
      this prospective study complement the extensive studies in animal models showing 
      EETs protect cardiac function and provide new information in humans. Replication 
      is needed to confirm the associations. FUNDING: US National Institutes of Health.

TI  - Effectiveness of exercise intervention during pregnancy on high-risk women for
      gestational diabetes mellitus prevention: A meta-analysis of published RCTs.
PG  - e0272711
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0272711 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We aimed at investigating the preventive role of exercise intervention
      during pregnancy, in high-risk women for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched PubMed, CENTRAL, and Scopus for randomized
      controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated exercise interventions during pregnancy
      on women at high risk for GDM. Data were combined with random effects models.
      Between study heterogeneity (Cochran's Q statistic) and the extent of study
      effects variability [I2 with 95% confidence interval (CI)] were estimated.
      Sensitivity analyses examined the effect of population, intervention, and study
      characteristics. We also evaluated the potential for publication bias. RESULTS:
      Among the 1,508 high-risk women who were analyzed in 9 RCTs, 374 (24.8%) [160
      (21.4%) in intervention, and 214 (28.1%) in control group] developed GDM. Women
      who received exercise intervention during pregnancy were less likely to develop
      GDM compared to those who followed the standard prenatal care (OR 0.70, 95%CI
      0.52, 0.93; P-value 0.02) [Q 10.08, P-value 0.26; I2 21% (95%CI 0, 62%]. Studies 
      with low attrition bias also showed a similar result (OR 0.70, 95%CI 0.51, 0.97; 
      P-value 0.03). A protective effect was also supported when analysis was limited
      to studies including women with low education level (OR 0.55; 95%CI 0.40, 0.74;
      P-value 0.0001); studies with exercise intervention duration more than 20 weeks
      (OR 0.54; 95%CI 0.40, 0.74; P-value 0.0007); and studies with a motivation
      component in the intervention (OR 0.69, 95%CI 0.50, 0.96; P-value 0.03). We could
      not exclude large variability in study effects because the upper limit of I2
      confidence interval was higher than 50% for all analyses. There was no conclusive
      evidence for small study effects (P-value 0.31). CONCLUSIONS: Our study might
      support a protective effect of exercise intervention during pregnancy for
      high-risk women to prevent GDM. The protective result should be corroborated by
      large, high quality RCTs.

AB  - The diagnosis of type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM) in humans is associated with high 
      altitude, few sunshine hours, cold climate, and winter. The goals of this study
      were to investigate seasonal and geographic patterns of DM diagnosis in United
      States of America (USA) dogs with juvenile and mature onset DM. Data were
      collected by means of an online survey widely distributed in the USA through
      breed clubs, academic veterinary institutions, private veterinary referral
      practices, social media outlets, and the American Kennel Club. Juvenile DM (JDM) 
      and mature onset DM were defined as DM with an age of onset <365 days and DM with
      an age of onset >/=365 days, respectively. Meteorological seasons were defined
      as: winter from December through February, spring from March through May, summer 
      from June through August, and fall from September through November. Four
      geographic regions were also defined as the West, North, South, and Central
      regions of the USA. Nonoverlapping 95% confidence intervals (CI) for season,
      geographic region, and breed specific proportions of dogs with JDM were
      considered statistically significantly different. The study included 933 dogs
      with mature onset DM and 27 dogs with JDM. Dogs were diagnosed with DM
      significantly more in the winter and northern USA compared to all other seasons
      and all other geographic regions, respectively. The prevalence of JDM among dogs 
      with DM was 2.8%. The proportion of dogs with JDM among pure breeds was not
      significantly different than the proportion of JDM in mixed breed dogs. It is
      concluded that winter and cold climate could be shared environmental factors
      influencing DM expression in dogs and humans. Additionally, pure breed dogs do
      not appear to be at increased risk for JDM compared to mixed breed dogs,
      indicating that factors other than genetics could influence spontaneous JDM
      development in dogs.

AB  - Using diabetes mobile apps for self-management of diabetes is one of the emerging
      strategies for controlling blood sugar levels and maintaining the wellness of
      patients with diabetes. This study aims to develop a strategy for thematically
      extracting user comments from diabetes mobile apps to understand the concern of
      patients with diabetes. Hence, 2678 user comments obtained from the Google Play
      Store are thematically analyzed with Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) to
      identify the themes for describing positive, neutral, and negative sentiments.
      These themes are used as the ground truth for developing a 10-fold
      cross-validation ensemble Multilayer Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model
      following the Bag of Word (BOW) analysis of lemmatized user comments. The result 
      shows that a total of 41.24% of positive sentimental users identified the
      diabetes mobile apps as Effective for Blood Sugar Monitoring (EBSM), 32.36% with 
      neutral sentiments are mostly impressed by the Information Quality (IQ), whereas 
      40.81% of unhappy users are worried about the Poor Information Quality (PIQ). The
      prediction accuracy of the ANN model is 89%-97%, which is 5%-48% better than
      other predominant algorithms. It can be concluded from this study that diabetes
      mobile apps with a simple user interface, effective data storage and security,
      medication adherence, and doctor appointment scheduling are preferred by patients
      with diabetes.

TI  - Cost-Effectiveness of iGlarLixi Versus Premix BIAsp 30 in People with Type 2
      Diabetes Suboptimally Controlled by Basal Insulin in the US.
LID - 10.1007/s13300-022-01300-5 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Many people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) experience
      suboptimal glycemic control and require therapy advancement. This
      cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted to compare iGlarLixi (insulin glargine 
      100 U/mL plus lixisenatide) versus BIAsp 30 (biphasic insulin aspart 30) in
      people with T2DM suboptimally controlled with basal insulin. METHODS: The IQVIA
      Core Diabetes Model was used to estimate lifetime costs and outcomes for people
      with T2DM from a US healthcare payer perspective. Initial clinical data were
      based on the phase 3 randomized, open-label, active-controlled SoliMix clinical
      study, which compared the efficacy and safety of once-daily iGlarLixi with
      twice-daily BIAsp 30. Lifetime costs (US$) and quality-adjusted life-years
      (QALYs) were predicted, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for
      iGlarLixi versus BIAsp 30 was estimated; the willingness-to-pay threshold was
      considered to be $50,000. A subgroup analysis considered people with T2DM aged
      >/= 65 years. RESULTS: Estimated QALYs gained were slightly higher with iGlarLixi
      compared with BIAsp 30 (9.3 vs. 9.2), with lower costs for iGlarLixi ($117,854
      vs. $120,109); the ICER for iGlarLixi was therefore considered dominant over
      BIAsp 30 in the base case. Key drivers for cost savings were the higher dose and 
      twice-daily administration for BIAsp 30 versus once-daily administration for
      iGlarLixi. The robustness of the base-case results was confirmed by sensitivity
      and scenario analyses. Results were similar in a subgroup of people with T2DM
      aged >/= 65 years. CONCLUSION: In people with T2DM with suboptimal glycemic
      control on basal insulin, iGlarLixi confers improved QALYs and reduced costs
      compared with BIAsp 30.

AB  - AIMS: Aerobic exercise is well recognised as an effective treatment for people
      with type 2 diabetes but the optimal amount of aerobic exercise to improve
      glycaemic control remains to be determined. Thus, the aim of this meta-analysis
      and meta-regression was to assess the impact of volume and intensity of aerobic
      exercise on glycaemic control. METHODS: Medline, Cochrane, Embase, and Web of
      Science databases were searched up until 15 December 2020 for the terms "aerobic 
      exercise AND glycaemic control", "type 2 diabetes AND exercise", and "exercise
      AND glycaemic control AND Type 2 diabetes AND randomised control trial". We
      included (i) randomised control trials of >/= 12 weeks, (ii) trials where
      participants had type 2 diabetes and were aged 18 or over, and (iii) the trial
      reported HbA1c concentrations pre- and post-intervention. Two reviewers selected 
      studies and extracted data. Data are reported as standardised mean difference
      (SMD) and publication bias was assessed using funnel plots. RESULTS: A total of
      5364 original titles were identified. Sixteen studies were included in the
      meta-analysis. Aerobic exercise reduced HbA1c versus control (SMD = 0.56 (95% CI 
      0.3-0.82), p < 0.001). There were also significant reductions in BMI (SMD = 0.76 
      (95% CI 0.25-1.27), p < 0.05). There was no dose-response relationship between
      improvement in HbA1c and the intensity and volume of the intervention (p > 0.05).
      CONCLUSIONS: Twelve-week or longer aerobic exercise programmes improve glycaemic 
      control and BMI in adults with type 2 diabetes. Longer or more intense
      interventions appear to confer no additional benefit on HbA1c.

TI  - Metagenomic analysis reveals crosstalk between gut microbiota and
      glucose-lowering drugs targeting the gastrointestinal tract in Chinese patients
      with type 2 diabetes: a 6 month, two-arm randomised trial.
LID - 10.1007/s00125-022-05768-5 [doi]
AB  - AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: The use of oral glucose-lowering drugs, particularly those
      designed to target the gut ecosystem, is often observed in association with
      altered gut microbial composition or functional capacity in individuals with type
      2 diabetes. The gut microbiota, in turn, plays crucial roles in the modulation of
      drug efficacy. We aimed to assess the impacts of acarbose and vildagliptin on
      human gut microbiota and the relationships between pre-treatment gut microbiota
      and therapeutic responses. METHODS: This was a randomised, open-labelled, two-arm
      trial in treatment-naive type 2 diabetes patients conducted in Beijing between
      December 2016 and December 2017. One hundred participants with overweight/obesity
      and newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes were recruited from the Pinggu Hospital and
      randomly assigned to the acarbose (n=50) or vildagliptin (n=50) group using
      sealed envelopes. The treatment period was 6 months. Blood, faecal samples and
      visceral fat data from computed tomography images were collected before and after
      treatments to measure therapeutic outcomes and gut microbiota. Metagenomic
      datasets from a previous type 2 diabetes cohort receiving acarbose or glipizide
      for 3 months were downloaded and processed. Statistical analyses were applied to 
      identify the treatment-related changes in clinical variables, gut microbiota and 
      associations. RESULTS: Ninety-two participants were analysed. After 6 months of
      acarbose (n=44) or vildagliptin (n=48) monotherapy, both groups achieved
      significant reductions in HbA1c (from 60 to 46 mmol/mol [from 7.65% to 6.40%] in 
      the acarbose group and from 59 to 44 mmol/mol [from 7.55% to 6.20%] in the
      vildagliptin group) and visceral fat areas (all adjusted p values for pre-post
      comparisons <0.05). Both arms showed drug-specific and shared changes in relative
      abundances of multiple gut microbial species and pathways, especially the common 
      reductions in Bacteroidetes species. Three months and 6 months of
      acarbose-induced changes in microbial composition were highly similar in type 2
      diabetes patients from the two independent studies. Vildagliptin treatment
      significantly enhanced fasting active glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) levels.
      Baseline gut microbiota, rather than baseline GLP-1 levels, were strongly
      associated with GLP-1 response to vildagliptin, and to a lesser extent with GLP-1
      response to acarbose. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: This study reveals common
      microbial responses in type 2 diabetes patients treated with two glucose-lowering
      drugs targeting the gut differently and acceptable performance of baseline gut
      microbiota in classifying individuals with different GLP-1 responses to
      vildagliptin. Our findings highlight bidirectional interactions between gut
      microbiota and glucose-lowering drugs. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov

TI  - The management of erectile dysfunction in men with diabetes mellitus unresponsive
      to Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors.
LID - 10.1111/andr.13257 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Erectile dysfunction (ED) is associated with diabetes mellitus with
      an estimated prevalence of 52.5% in the diabetic population. The first-line
      therapy for ED are phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE5i), but data suggests
      that diabetic men may be less responsive than non-diabetic men. Thus, other
      treatments, including intracavernosal injections, intraurethral prostaglandin,
      vacuum erection devices, and penile prosthetic surgery, should be considered in
      management of diabetic men with ED refractory to PDE5i. Furthermore, combination 
      therapy of PDE5i and other oral treatments such as arginine or L-carnitine may
      have synergistic effects resulting in better outcomes. In addition, there are
      novel therapies such as low-intensity shockwave therapy and stem cell therapy
      which may also be effective targeted treatment modalities. Furthermore, studies
      suggest that ED can be improved by targeting concurrent comorbidities or
      metabolic diseases such as depression, hypertension, hypogonadism, and
      dyslipidaemia. We present an evidence-based narrative review focussing on the
      management of ED in diabetic men who have not responded to PDE5i. CONCLUSIONS:
      Both clinicians and patients should be aware of the different management options 
      in Diabetic patients who have responded to PDE5i. This article is protected by

TI  - beta-cell dynamics in type 2 diabetes and in dietary and exercise interventions.
LID - mjac046 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/jmcb/mjac046 [doi]
AB  - Pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction and insulin resistance are two of the major
      causes of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Recent clinical and experimental studies have
      suggested that the functional capacity of beta-cells, particularly in the first
      phase of insulin secretion, is a primary contributor to the progression of T2D
      and its associated complications. Pancreatic beta-cells undergo dynamic
      compensation and decompensation processes during the development of T2D, in which
      metabolic stresses such as endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, oxidative stress,
      and inflammatory signals are key regulators of beta-cell dynamics. Dietary and
      exercise interventions have been shown to be effective approaches for the
      treatment of obesity and T2D, especially in the early stages. Whilst the targeted
      tissues and underlying mechanisms of dietary and exercise interventions remain
      somewhat vague, accumulating evidence has implicated the improvement of beta-cell
      functional capacity. In this review, we summarize recent advances in the
      understanding of the dynamic adaptations of beta-cell function in T2D progression
      and clarify the effects and mechanisms of dietary and exercise interventions on
      beta-cell dysfunction in T2D. This review provides molecular insights into the
      therapeutic effects of dietary and exercise interventions on T2D, and more
      importantly, it paves the way for future research on the related underlying
      mechanisms for developing precision prevention and treatment of T2D.

TI  - Specnuezhenide suppresses diabetes-induced bone loss by inhibiting RANKL-induced 
      osteoclastogenesis.
LID - 10.3724/abbs.2022094 [doi]
AB  - Diabetes osteoporosis is a chronic complication of diabetes mellitus (DM) and is 
      associated with osteoclast formation and enhanced bone resorption. Specnuezhenide
      (SPN) is an active compound with anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory
      properties. However, the roles of SPN in diabetic osteoporosis remain unknown. In
      this study, primary bone marrow macrophages (BMMs) were pretreated with SPN and
      were stimulated with receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL; 
      to induce osteoclastogenesis. The number of osteoclasts was detected by
      tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining. The protein levels of
      cellular oncogene fos/nuclear factor of activated T cells c1 (c-Fos/NFATc1),
      nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kappaB), and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs)
      were evaluated by western blot analysis. NF-kappaB luciferase assays were used to
      examine the role of SPN in NF-kappaB activation. The DM model group received a
      high-glucose, high-fat diet and was then intraperitoneally injected with
      streptozotocin (STZ). Micro-CT scanning, serum biochemical analysis, histological
      analysis were used to assess bone loss. We found that SPN suppressed
      RANKL-induced osteoclast formation and that SPN inhibited the expression of
      osteoclast-related genes and c-Fos/NFATc1. SPN inhibited RANKL-induced activation
      of NF-kappaB and MAPKs. In vivo experiments revealed that SPN suppressed
      diabetes-induced bone loss and the number of osteoclasts. Furthermore, SPN
      decreased the levels of bone turnover markers and increased the levels of
      runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2), osteoprotegerin (OPG), calcium (Ca) 
      and phosphorus (P). SPN also regulated diabetes-related markers. This study
      suggests that SPN suppresses diabetes-induced bone loss by inhibiting
      RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis, and provides an experimental basis for the
      treatment of diabetic osteoporosis.

TI  - Tirzepatide for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes: an endocrine
      perspective.
LID - 10.1111/dom.14831 [doi]
AB  - Tirzepatide is a novel GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonist approved for treatment of
      people with type 2 diabetes in the US and under investigation for use in chronic 
      weight management, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and the management 
      of other conditions, including heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and
      obesity and noncirrhotic non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. The Phase 3 SURPASS 1-5
      clinical trial programme was designed to assess efficacy and safety of
      once-weekly subcutaneously injected tirzepatide (5, 10, and 15 mg), as
      monotherapy or combination therapy, across a broad spectrum of people with type 2
      diabetes. Use of tirzepatide in clinical studies was associated with marked
      reductions of HbA1c (-1.87 to -2.59%, -20 to -28 mmol/mol) and body weight (6.2
      to 12.9 kg), as well as reductions in parameters commonly associated with
      heightened cardiometabolic risk such as blood pressure, visceral adiposity, and
      circulating triglycerides. In SUPRASS-2, these reductions were greater than with 
      the GLP-1 receptor agonist semaglutide 1 mg. Tirzepatide was well tolerated, with
      a low risk of hypoglycaemia when used without insulin or insulin secretagogues
      and showed a generally similar safety profile to the GLP-1 receptor agonist
      class. Accordingly, evidence from these clinical trials suggests that tirzepatide
      offers a new opportunity for effective lowering of HbA1c and body weight in
      adults with type 2 diabetes. This article is protected by copyright. All rights

TI  - Reconsidering the role of glycemic control on cardiovascular disease risk in type
      2 diabetes: A 21(st) century assessment.
LID - 10.1111/dom.14830 [doi]
AB  - It is well known that the multiple factors contributing to the pathogenesis of
      type 2 diabetes (T2D) confer an increased risk of developing cardiovascular
      disease (CVD). Although the relationship between hyperglycemia and increased
      microvascular risk is well established, the relative contribution of
      hyperglycemia to macrovascular events has been strongly debated, particularly
      owing to the failure of attempts to reduce CVD risk through normalizing glycemia 
      with traditional therapies in high-risk populations. The debate has been further 
      fueled by the relatively recent discovery of the cardioprotective properties of
      glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and sodium-glucose transport protein-2 
      inhibitors. Further, as guidelines now recommend individualizing glycemic
      targets, highlighting the importance of achieving HbA1c goals safely, the
      previously observed negative influences of intensive therapy on CVD risk might
      not present if trials were repeated using current-day treatments and
      individualized HbA1c goals. Emerging longitudinal data illuminate the overall
      effect of excess glucose, the impacts of magnitude and duration of hyperglycemia 
      on disease progression and risk of CVD complications, and the importance of
      glycemic control at or early after diagnosis of T2D for prevention of
      complications. Herein, we review the role of glucose as a modifiable
      cardiovascular risk factor, the role of microvascular disease in predicting
      macrovascular risk, and the deleterious impact of therapeutic inertia on CVD
      risk. We reconcile new and old data to offer a current perspective highlighting
      the importance of effective, early treatment in reducing latent cardiovascular
      risk, and the timely use of appropriate therapy individualized to each patient's 
      needs. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

TI  - Effect of Canagliflozin on Total Cardiovascular Burden in Patients With Diabetes 
      and Chronic Kidney Disease: A Post Hoc Analysis From the CREDENCE Trial.
PG  - e025045
LID - 10.1161/JAHA.121.025045 [doi]
AB  - Background The sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor canagliflozin reduced the
      risk of first cardiovascular composite events in the CREDENCE (Canagliflozin and 
      Renal Events in Diabetes With Established Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation) trial.
      In this post hoc analysis, we evaluated the effect of canagliflozin on total
      (first and recurrent) cardiovascular events. Methods and Results The CREDENCE
      trial compared canagliflozin or matching placebo in 4401 patients with type 2
      diabetes, albuminuria, and estimated glomerular filtration rate of 30 to <90
      mL/min per 1.73 m(2), over a median of 2.6 years. The primary outcome was
      analyzed as a composite of any cardiovascular event including myocardial
      infarction, stroke, hospitalization for heart failure, hospitalization for
      unstable angina, and cardiovascular death. Negative binomial regression models
      were used to assess the effect of canagliflozin on the net burden of
      cardiovascular events. During the trial, 634 patients had 883 cardiovascular
      events, of whom 472 (74%) had just 1 cardiovascular event and 162 (26%) had
      multiple cardiovascular events. Canagliflozin reduced first cardiovascular events
      by 26% (hazard ratio, 0.74 [95% CI, 0.63-0.86]; P<0.001) and total cardiovascular
      events by 29% (incidence rate ratio, 0.71 [95% CI, 0.59-0.86]; P<0.001). The
      absolute risk difference per 1000 patients treated over 2.5 years was -44 (95%
      CI, -67 to -21) first cardiovascular events and -73 (95% CI, -114 to -33) total
      events. Conclusions Canagliflozin reduced cardiovascular events, with a larger
      absolute benefit for total cardiovascular than first cardiovascular events. These
      findings provide further support for the benefit of continuing canagliflozin
      therapy after an initial event to prevent recurrent cardiovascular events.

TI  - Anti-embolism devices therapy to improve the ICU mortality rate of patients with 
      acute myocardial infarction and type II diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 948924

AB  - Background: Anti-Embolism (AE) devices therapy is an additional antithrombotic
      treatment that is effective in many venous diseases, but the correlations between
      this medical compression therapy and cardiovascular arterial disease or comorbid 
      diabetes mellitus (DM) are still controversial. In this study we investigated the
      association between compression therapy and intensive care unit (ICU) mortality
      in patients with a first acute myocardial infarction (AMI) diagnosis complicated 
      with type II DM. Methods: This retrospective cohort study analyzed all patients
      with AMI and type II DM in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV
      database. We extracted the demographics, vital signs, laboratory test results,
      comorbidities, and scoring system results of patients from the first 24 h after
      ICU admission. The outcomes of this study were 28-day mortality and ICU
      mortality. Analyses included Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, Cox
      proportional-hazards regression, and subgroup analysis. Results: The study
      included 985 eligible patients with AMI and type II DM, of who 293 and 692 were
      enrolled into the no-AE device therapy and AE device therapy groups,
      respectively. In the multivariate analysis, compared with no-AE device therapy,
      AE device therapy was a significant predictor of 28-day mortality (OR = 0.48, 95%
      CI = 0.24-0.96, P = 0.039) and ICU mortality (OR = 0.50, 95% CI = 0.27-0.90, P = 
      0.021). In addition to age, gender and coronary artery bypass grafting surgery,
      there were no significant interactions of AE device therapy and other related
      risk factors with ICU mortality and 28-day mortality in the subgroup analysis.
      Conclusions: Simple-AE-device therapy was associated with reduced risks of ICU
      mortality and 28-day mortality, as well as an improvement in the benefit on
      in-hospital survival in patients with AMI complicated with type II DM.

TI  - Using Glycated Albumin and Stimulated C-Peptide to Define Partial Remission in
      Type 1 Diabetes.
PG  - 938059
LID - 10.3389/fendo.2022.938059 [doi]
AB  - Objective: To propose a new definition of partial remission (PR) for patients
      with type 1 diabetes (T1D) of all-ages using insulin dose and glycated albumin
      (GA), and find the optimal cut-off values for stimulated C-peptide to diagnose PR
      in different age-groups. Research Design and Methods: Patients with newly
      diagnosed T1D (n=301) were included. GA/insulin dose was used to diagnose PR, and
      insulin dose-adjusted glycated albumin (IDAGA) was proposed to facilitate
      clinical application. The optimal diagnostic levels of IDAGA and stimulated
      C-peptide were determined in different age-groups (</= 12y, 12-18y and >/= 18y). 
      Furthermore, the diagnostic consistency between different PR definitions was
      studied. Results: GA</= 23%/insulin dose </= 0.5u/kg/day was used to define PR,
      and IDAGA (GA (%) + 40 * insulin dose(u/kg/day)) </= 40 was feasible in all
      age-groups. Whereas, the optimal diagnostic level showed difference for
      stimulated C-peptide (265.5, 449.3 and 241.1 pmol/L for the </= 12y, 12-18y and
      >/= 18y age-group, respectively). About 40% of patients met the PR definition by 
      stimulated C-peptide but not GA/insulin dose or IDAGA, who showed dyslipidemia
      and higher insulin resistance. Conclusions: A new definition of the PR phase is
      proposed using GA/insulin dose, and the calculated IDAGA</= 40 applies to all
      age-groups. The stimulated C-peptide to diagnose PR is the highest in the 12-18y 
      age-group, which reflects the effect of puberty on metabolism. For patients with 
      insulin resistance, it is not recommended to use stimulated C-peptide alone to
      diagnose PR.

TI  - The Relative Body Weight Gain From Early to Middle Life Adulthood Associated With
      Later Life Risk of Diabetes: A Nationwide Cohort Study.
PG  - 927067
LID - 10.3389/fendo.2022.927067 [doi]
AB  - Aim: To determine the effect of decade-based body weight gain from 20 to 50 years
      of age on later life diabetes risk. Methods: 35,611 non-diabetic participants
      aged >/= 50 years from a well-defined nationwide cohort were followed up for
      average of 3.6 years, with cardiovascular diseases and cancers at baseline were
      excluded. Body weight at 20, 30, 40, and 50 years was reported. The overall 30
      years and each 10-year weight gain were calculated from the early and middle
      life. Cox regression models were used to estimate risks of incident diabetes.
      Results: After 127,745.26 person-years of follow-up, 2,789 incident diabetes were
      identified (incidence rate, 2.18%) in 25,289 women (mean weight gain 20-50 years,
      7.60 kg) and 10,322 men (7.93 kg). Each 10-kg weight gain over the 30 years was
      significantly associated with a 39.7% increased risk of incident diabetes (95%
      confidence interval [CI], 1.33-1.47); weight gain from 20-30 years showed a more 
      prominent effect on the risk of developing diabetes before 60 years than that of 
      after 60 years (Hazard ratio, HR = 1.084, 95% CI [1.049-1.121], P <0.0001 vs.
      1.015 [0.975-1.056], P = 0.4643; P Interaction=0.0293). It showed a stable effect
      of the three 10-year intervals weight gain on risk of diabetes after 60 years
      (HR=1.055, 1.038, 1.043, respectively, all P < 0.0036). Conclusions: The early
      life weight gain showed a more prominent effect on developing diabetes before 60 
      years than after 60 years; however, each-decade weight gain from 20 to 50 years
      showed a similar effect on risk developing diabetes after 60 years.

TI  - Self-management interventions for Type 2 Diabetes: systematic review protocol
      focusing on patient workload and capacity support.
PG  - 257
LID - 10.12688/wellcomeopenres.17238.1 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: People living with type 2 diabetes undertake a range of tasks to
      manage their condition, collectively referred to as self-management.
      Interventions designed to support self-management vary in their content, and
      efficacy. This systematic review will analyse self-management interventions for
      type 2 diabetes drawing on theoretical models of patient workload and capacity.
      METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Five electronic databases (Medline, Embase, CENTRAL, CINAHL
      and PsycINFO) will be searched from inception to 27th April 2021, supplemented by
      citation searching and hand-searching of reference lists. Two reviewers will
      independently review titles, abstracts and full texts. Inclusion criteria include
      Population: Adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus; Intervention: Randomised
      controlled trials of self-management support interventions; Comparison: Usual
      care; Outcomes: HbA1c (primary outcome) health-related quality of life (QOL),
      medication adherence, self-efficacy, treatment burden, healthcare utilization
      (e.g. number of appointment, hospital admissions), complications of type 2
      diabetes (e.g. nephropathy, retinopathy, neuropathy, macrovascular disease) and
      mortality; Setting: Community. Study quality will be assessed using the Effective
      Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) risk of bias tool. Interventions will be
      classified according to the EPOC taxonomy and the PRISMS self-management taxonomy
      and grouped into similar interventions for analysis. Clinical and methodological 
      heterogeneity will be assessed within subgroups, and random effects meta-analyses
      performed if appropriate. Otherwise, a narrative synthesis will be performed.
      Interventions will be graded on their likely impact on patient workload and
      support for patient capacity. The impact of these theoretical constructs on study
      outcomes will be explored using meta-regression. Conclusion This review will
      provide a broad overview of self-management interventions, analysed within the
      cumulative complexity model theoretical framework. Analyses will explore how the 
      workload associated with self-management, and support for patient capacity,
      impact on outcomes of self-management interventions. REGISTRATION NUMBER:

AB  - The placenta is a vital organ for fetal development, providing the fetus with
      nutrients, oxygen, and other important factors. Placenta is rich in blood
      vessels. Abnormal placental vascular function and blood circulation may lead to
      insufficient blood supply to the fetus in the uterus, leading to serious
      consequences such as pregnancy complications, fetal distress and even stillbirth.
      Pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are 
      common complications of pregnancy. Recent studies report that pregnancy
      complications are often accompanied by changes in placental vascular structure
      and function. What are the physiological characteristics of human placental blood
      vessels? What are the pathological changes in the state of PIH and GDM? What are 
      the relationships between these pathological changes and the occurrence of these 
      pregnancy complications? Answers to these questions not only increase the
      understanding of placental vascular characteristics, but also provide important
      information for revealing the pathological mechanism of PIH and GDM. This article
      will summarize the research on the pathological changes of placental blood
      vessels in PIH and GDM, hoping to further unravel the physiological and
      pathological characteristics of placental blood vessels in the state of PIH and
      GDM, provide information for guiding clinical treatment for PIH and GDM.

AB  - Dehydration and acidosis increase the risk for urinary stone formation. Urinary
      stones have been reported in three pediatric cases of diabetic ketoacidosis
      (DKA). A 24-h urine collection was performed for two of the three children. One
      patient had high urine sodium levels, while the other had low urine citrate
      excretion. We report the case of a 12-yr-old adolescent boy with urinary stones, 
      new-onset type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D), and DKA, excluding other metabolic
      disorders. After DKA was diagnosed, the patient received a 0.9% saline bolus and 
      continuous insulin infusion. Hyperglycemia and ketoacidosis were well-controlled 
      on the third day after admission. However, the patient developed abdominal pain
      radiating to the back. Urinary stones were suspected, and a urinalysis was
      performed. The patient's urine revealed significant elevation in red blood cells 
      and calcium oxalate crystals. Computed tomography revealed a high-density left
      ureteric mass, suggestive of a urinary stone. Although both the previously
      reported pediatric cases involved metabolic diseases, additional tests in this
      patient excluded metabolic diseases other than T1D. DKA may be related to the
      formation of calcium oxalate crystals owing to dehydration and acidosis.
      Therefore, physicians should consider urinary stone formation in DKA patients.

AB  - Neonatal diabetes mellitus (NDM) is a rare metabolic disorder that is mainly
      present in the first 6 months of life and necessitates insulin treatment.
      Sensor-augmented pump (SAP) therapy has been widely used in children with type 1 
      diabetes mellitus, but its use in patients with NDM is limited. We report three
      patients with NDM who received SAP therapy using the MiniMed 640G system starting
      in the neonatal period. Two patients were treated for 3 months, and one patient
      continued treatment up to an age of 22 mo. The MiniMed 640G system can
      automatically suspend insulin delivery (SmartGuard Technology) to avoid
      hypoglycemia when the sensor glucose level is predicted to approach the
      predefined threshold. We suggest that SmartGuard Technology is particularly
      useful for infants in whom hypoglycemia cannot be identified. The MiniMed 640G
      system automatically records the trends of sensor glucose levels and the total
      daily dose of insulin, which can make the management more accurate and reduce the
      family's effort. SAP therapy for patients with NDM automatically prevents severe 
      hypoglycemia and is useful for long-term management; however, attention should be
      paid to its application.

PG  - 168-171

AB  - Neonatal diabetes mellitus is a rare monogenic condition affecting 1 in
      100,000-300,000 live births. Mutations in the subunits of ATP-sensitive potassium
      (KATP) channels, which are the central gatekeepers of electrical activity, are
      the common cause of this condition, thereby reducing insulin secretion in the
      pancreatic beta cells. Most cases are diagnosed before 6 mo of age. The
      development of this condition in the latter half of the first year of life is
      rare; hence, testing in older infants is not routinely performed. Here, we
      describe the case of a patient who presented with neonatal diabetes mellitus and 
      diabetic ketoacidosis at 10 mo of age. All the pancreatic autoantibodies were
      undetectable, prompting us to pursue genetic testing. At 13 yr of age, a
      heterozygous missense variant, C42R, was identified in the KCNJ11 gene by exome
      sequencing. Subsequently, sulfonylurea was initiated, and insulin therapy was
      discontinued that resulted in improved blood glucose control and increased
      C-peptide levels. Given the potential benefit of switching to oral medication,
      genetic testing should be extended to all infants diagnosed with
      antibody-negative diabetes before 1 yr of age.

AB  - The auditory pathway is the main target for high levels of blood sugar. Increased
      glucose in diabetic patients can disrupt the auditory system physiologically and 
      anatomically. The present study aimed to examine the prevalence of hearing loss
      in patients with type 2 diabetes. A total of 94 patients with type 2 diabetes,
      aged from 40 to 80 years, were selected randomly in the present descriptive
      cross-sectional study for pure tone audiometry (PTA), speech discrimination score
      (SDS), and speech reception threshold (SRT) tests. Accordingly, patients with a
      hearing threshold larger than or equal to 25 dB were considered hearing-impaired 
      according to the PTA test. In addition, the patients' speech discrimination score
      was measured using a list of monosyllabic words with an intensity of 40 dB or
      more than the SDS test. However, in the SRT test, the patients' superficial
      speech comprehension threshold was measured using a list of two-syllable words.
      Most diabetic patients had hearing loss in both right and left ears based on the 
      PTA and SRT tests. However, they did not have hearing loss in both ears according
      to the SDS test. There was no correlation between the PTA, SRT, and SDS tests and
      blood creatinine levels in both ears (p>0.05). Nevertheless, the right ear had a 
      positive correlation with systolic blood pressure only in the PTA test (p<0.05). 
      The difference between the two groups of men and women with type 2 diabetes in
      the hearing level in the right and left ears was not statistically significant.
      Hearing loss is a common deficiency in diabetic patients. In addition, it seems
      that diabetes is an independent risk factor for the hearing loss level.

AB  - Serum creatinine level begins to increase after a decrease in glomerular
      filtration rate (GFR) by 50% and more, so the question emerged about a more
      accurate method of determining GFR. The study aimed to determine the role of
      renal damage markers in the diagnosis of early-stage renal disease in patients
      with latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA). We included 84 patients with
      diabetes mellitus (DM) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) caused by diabetic kidney
      disease (DKD), as well as 25 representatives of the control group. Patients were 
      divided into three groups - 43 people with LADA, 21 with type 1 diabetes mellitus
      (T1DM), and 20 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). GFR was assessed
      using six formulas after establishing the category of GFR and albuminuria. The
      GFR rate estimated by the CKD-EPI formula in patients with LADA and DKD did not
      significantly differ from that of CKD-EPI cysC, slightly different from MDRD GFR 
      (10.6% higher, respectively) but 21.9% lower compared to CG formula. In patients 
      with LADA and T1DM, GFR was higher in cases with existing albuminuria, regardless
      of the formulas used. Thus, the non albuminuria phenotype is accompanied by a
      greater degree of renal impairment, which indicates the need to determine serum
      cystatin C in the early stages of LADA. Cystatin C levels are the most accurate, 
      early, and independent predictor of the development and progression of CKD in
      patients with DM, including LADA.

      role of racial discrimination.
PG  - 101176
LID - 10.1016/j.ssmph.2022.101176 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: Racial/ethnic minority and foreign-born women in the United States 
      are at high risk of experiencing racial discrimination, which is associated with 
      adverse health outcomes. Although racial discrimination is associated with
      metabolic disturbances such as insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, more
      studies should examine its effect on gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), which
      is highest among racial/ethnic minority and foreign-born women. Methods: We used 
      New York City Pregnancy Risk and Assessment Monitoring System survey data
      (2012-2014) linked with birth certificate items (N = 4084) in bivariate and
      multivariate analyses to examine racial/ethnic/nativity differences in racial
      discrimination, and to test if racial discrimination explains
      racial/ethnic/nativity inequalities in GDM. Results: The 12-month prevalence of
      racial discrimination (9.5%) varied across race/ethnicity and nativity status,
      with Black, Hispanic and foreign-born women having the highest prevalence.
      Interaction effects indicate that US-born Black and Hispanic women are at
      increased risk of racial discrimination compared to their foreign-born
      counterparts. Women with GDM had statistically higher prevalence of racial
      discrimination (14%) compared with women without GDM (9%). Racial discrimination 
      was associated with a 57% increased unadjusted risk of GDM (RR = 1.57, 95% CI
      [1.19, 2.06]) that decreased to 24% after adjusting for all covariates (RR =
      1.24, 95% CI [0.87, 1.78]). Discussion: The high proportion of racial/ethnic
      minority and foreign-born women experiencing racial discrimination, and its
      potential impact on GDM, underscores the importance of culturally informed
      screening and intervention approaches by trained professionals.

AB  - Background/Purpose: To study the clinical characteristics, outcomes, and the
      incidence of postpartum diabetes in women with overt diabetes and GDM. Methods:
      This prospective cohort observational study was done on women with GDM diagnosed 
      after the first trimester, attending the tertiary care hospitals for 2.3 years.
      Comparison of clinical variables and maternal and neonatal outcomes were recorded
      in women with overt diabetes and GDM. The postpartum glycemic status was
      determined at 1 and 6 months. Results: There were 32(17.9%) women with overt
      diabetes and 146(82.1%) women with GDM. Women with overt diabetes were older, had
      a higher frequency of pre-pregnancy and maternal obesity, family history of
      diabetes, previous history of GDM, polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), signs of
      insulin resistance, and need for insulin treatment than women with GDM. The
      prevalence of gestational hypertension and frequency of spontaneous abortion and 
      large for gestational age (LGA) neonates were significantly higher in women with 
      overt diabetes than in GDM, despite comparable glycemic goals. Postpartum
      diabetes at 1 and 6 months was significantly higher in women with overt diabetes 
      than in those with GDM. Conclusion: It is critical to identify women with overt
      diabetes in pregnancy because of increased risk of adverse maternal and neonatal 
      outcomes, and rapid progression to postpartum diabetes, despite achieving optimal
      glycemic goals.

AB  - Several cellular and molecular therapies such as stem cell therapy, cell
      replacement therapy, gene modification therapy and tolerance induction therapy
      have been researched to procure a permanent cure for Type 1 Diabetes.However, due
      to the induction of undesirable side effects, their clinical utility is
      questionable. These anti-diabetic therapies can be modified with
      nanotechnological tools for reducing adverse effects by selectively targeting
      genes and/or receptors involved directly or indirectly in the diabetes
      pathogenesis such as the glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor, epidermal growth
      factor receptor, human leukocyte antigen [HLA] gene, miRNA gene and hepatocyte
      growth factor [HGF] gene. This paper will review the utilities of nanotechnology 
      in stem cell therapy, cell replacement therapy, beta-cell proliferation
      strategies, immune tolerance induction strategies and gene therapy for type 1

      diabetes mellitus - A comprehensive review.

AB  - Several epigenome studies reported the ability of genes to modulate the
      lipogenic, and glucogenic pathways during insulin signaling as well as the other 
      pathways involved in the cardiometabolic diseases. Epigenetic plasticity and
      oxidative stress are interrelated in the pathophysiology of the insulin
      resistance (IR) and cardiometabolic disease conditions. The aim of this review is
      to ascertain the previous research evidences pertinent to the role of epigenome
      and the variations of histone and non-histone proteins during cardiometabolic
      disease conditions, and insulin signaling finally to develop effective
      disease-based epigenetic biomarkers and epigenetics-based chromatic therapy.
      Several public databases including 'PubMed, National Library of Medicine, and
      Medline, and google scholar' were searched for the peer-reviewed & published
      reports. This study delineated the consistent body of evidences regarding the
      epigenetic alterations of DNA/histone complexes pertinent to oxidative stress,
      insulin signaling, metabolic cardiomyopathy, and endothelial dysfunction in the
      patients with cardiometabolic diseases, T2DM. It has been described that both DNA
      methylation as well as the post-translational histone alterations across visceral
      and subcutaneous adipose tissue could facilitate gene transcription to modulate
      the inflammation, lipogenesis and adipogenesis as complex network of
      chromatinmodifying enzymatic proteins involved in the defensive insulin signaling
      across vasculature in the patients with cardiometabolic diseases. Resveratrol,
      vornistat, trichostatin, and apabetalone are reported to have significant
      implications as epigenetic modulators. Based on the epigenetic alterations, a
      wide-range of protein/gene markers such as interleukin-4 (IL-4), interferon-gamma
      (IFNgamma) genes may be considered as biomarkers in these patients due to their
      ability for polarization of immune cells involved in tissue inflammation and
      atherosclerosis. Hence, it is crucial to unravel the cell specific epigenetic
      information in advance in order to develop individual risk assessment strategies 
      for chromatin modifying therapies in the patients with cardiometabolic diseases.

TI  - Causal relationship between type 1 diabetes and hypothyroidism: A Mendelian
      randomization study.
LID - 10.1111/cen.14801 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Although an association between type 1 diabetes (T1D) and
      hypothyroidism has been found in multiple observational studies, whether T1D
      plays a causal role in the development of hypothyroidism remains uncertain.
      Therefore, this Mendelian randomization (MR) study aimed to investigate the
      causal association between T1D and hypothyroidism. METHODS: Independent
      single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with T1D with genome-wide significance
      were selected as instrumental variables from a large genome-wide association
      study (GWAS) of T1D. Hypothyroidism GWAS summary statistics were obtained from
      the ThyroidOmics Consortium. The inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method was used 
      as the primary analysis for estimating the effect of the exposure on the outcome.
      We also used MR-Egger, the weighted median method, MR-Robust, and other methods
      to confirm the results. RESULTS: T1D had a positive causal association with
      hypothyroidism (IVW, odds ratio [OR]=1.083, 95% confidence interval [CI],
      1.046-1.122; P<0.001). MR-Egger regression indicated that directional pleiotropy 
      did not bias the result (intercept=0.006; P=0.295). The causal association was
      verified in an independent validation set (IVW, OR=1.099, 95% CI, 1.018-1.186;
      P=0.017). The results were robust according to various MR methods, and the
      results of the reverse MR analysis did not support reverse causation (P>0.05).
      CONCLUSIONS: The MR analysis results indicated a causal association between T1D
      and hypothyroidism. Therefore, it is recommended that patients with T1D should
      undergo thyroid function tests regularly in order to minimize the risk of
      undiagnosed hypothyroidism among young patients with T1D. This article is

TI  - Determinants of acute kidney injury in children with new onset type 1 diabetes: A
      cohort study of children aged <15 years: Auckland, New Zealand (2006-2016).
PG  - e362
LID - 10.1002/edm2.362 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Acute kidney injury (AKI) may contribute to the risk of diabetic
      kidney disease, however, there have been limited studies of the incidence of AKI 
      in well-defined populations of children with type 1 diabetes. The aim was to
      quantify AKI in children presenting with new onset type 1 diabetes from the
      regional paediatric diabetes service, Auckland, New Zealand. RESEARCH DESIGN AND 
      METHODS: A retrospective analysis of a prospectively identified cohort study of
      children and adolescents presenting from 2006 to 2016 with type 1 diabetes aged
      <15 years. AKI was defined using Kidney Disease/Improving Global Outcomes serum
      creatinine criteria. RESULTS: There were 586 subjects: 52% male, with mean (SD)
      age 8.9 (3.8) years, with 151(25.8%) in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). AKI was
      present in 47%, 278/586, AKI was increased in those with DKA (125/151 (83%) DKA
      vs. 153/435 (35%) no-DKA). Univariable analysis showed that increased HbA1c,
      higher glucose levels, lower BMI SDS, lower bicarbonate and pH levels were all
      associated with AKI (p < .001). In multivariable analysis, AKI was associated
      with DKA and higher glucose levels independently. The majority of cases were
      stage 1 (203/278 [73%]), or stage 2 AKI 62/278 (22%). 13/278 (5%) had severe,
      Stage 3 AKI, and all presented in DKA (13/151 (8%) vs. 0/435 (0%) without DKA, p 
      < .001). CONCLUSION: In this regional paediatric, cohort AKI is a common
      complication of children presenting with new onset type 1 diabetes. AKI is
      independently associated with higher glucose levels and DKA, and all cases of
      Stage 3 AKI were associated with DKA.

TI  - Circulating osteocalcin is associated with time in range and other metrics
      assessed by continuous glucose monitoring in type 2 diabetes.
PG  - 109
LID - 10.1186/s13098-022-00863-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Osteocalcin, a protein secreted mainly by mature osteoblasts, has
      been shown to be involved in glucose metabolism through various pathways.
      However, few studies has explored the association between osteocalcin and Time in
      range (TIR). Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) -derived metrics, such as TIR
      and other indexes have been gradually and widely used in clinical practice to
      assess glucose fluctuations. The main purpose of this study was to investigate
      the correlation between osteocalcin and indexes from CGM in patients with type 2 
      diabetes mellitus (T2DM). METHOD: The total number of 376 patients with T2D were 
      enrolled, all of them performed three consecutive days of monitoring. They were
      divided into four groups on account of the quartile of osteocalcin. Time in
      range, Time below range (TBR), Time above range(TAR) and measures of glycemic
      variability (GV) were assessed for analysing. After a 100 g standard steamed
      bread meal, blood glucose (Glu0h Glu0.5 h, Glu1h, Glu2h, GLu3h), C-peptide (Cp0h,
      Cp0.5 h, Cp1h, Cp2h, Cp3h), serum insulin (INS0h, INS0.5 h, INS1h, INS2h, INS3h) 
      concentrations at different time points were obtained. HOMA-IS, HOMA-betawas
      calculated to evaluate insulin sensitivity and insulin secreting of the
      participants. RESULTS: Patients with higher osteocalcin level had higher TIR (P <
      0.05). Spearman correlation analysis showed that osteocalcin was positively
      correlated with TBR (although the P value for TBR was greater than 0.05) (r =
      0.227, P < 0.001 r = 0.068, P = 0.189) and negatively correlated with TAR (-
      0.229, P < 0.001). Similarly, there was a negative correlation between
      osteocalcin and glycemic variability (GV) indicators, including SD, MBG, MODD,
      ADDR, and MAGE (P value of MAGE > 0.05). Multiple stepwise regression showed that
      osteocalcin was an independent contributor to TIR, TAR and HOMA-IS. CONCLUSION:
      Circulating osteocalcin is positively correlated with TIR and negatively
      correlated with MODD, ADDR, and MAGE. Osteocalcin may have a beneficial impact on
      glucose homeostasis in T2DM patients.

TI  - Cardiovascular outcomes trials: a paradigm shift in the current management of
      type 2 diabetes.
PG  - 144
LID - 10.1186/s12933-022-01575-9 [doi]
AB  - Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality and morbidity in
      patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Historical concerns about cardiovascular
      (CV) risks associated with certain glucose-lowering medications gave rise to the 
      introduction of cardiovascular outcomes trials (CVOTs). Initially implemented to 
      help monitor the CV safety of glucose-lowering drugs in patients with T2D, who
      either had established CVD or were at high risk of CVD, data that emerged from
      some of these trials started to show benefits. Alongside the anticipated CV
      safety of many of these agents, evidence for certain sodium-glucose transporter 2
      (SGLT2) inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) have
      revealed potential cardioprotective effects in patients with T2D who are at high 
      risk of CVD events. Reductions in 3-point major adverse CV events (3P-MACE) and
      CV death have been noted in some of these CVOTs, with additional benefits
      including reduced risks of hospitalisation for heart failure, progression of
      renal disease, and all-cause mortality. These new data are leading to a paradigm 
      shift in the current management of T2D, with international guidelines now
      prioritising SGLT2 inhibitors and/or GLP-1 RAs in certain patient populations.
      However, clinicians are faced with a large volume of CVOT data when seeking to
      use this evidence base to bring opportunities to improve CV, heart failure and
      renal outcomes, and even reduce mortality, in their patients with T2D. The aim of
      this review is to provide an in-depth summary of CVOT data-crystallising the key 
      findings, from safety to efficacy-and to offer a practical perspective for
      physicians. Finally, we discuss the next steps for the post-CVOT era, with
      ongoing studies that may further transform clinical practice and improve outcomes
      for people with T2D, heart failure or renal disease.

TI  - Racial and Ethnic Differences in Medication Initiation Among Adults Newly
      Diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes.
LID - 10.1007/s11606-022-07746-4 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Given persistent racial/ethnic differences in type 2 diabetes outcomes
      and the lasting benefits conferred by early glycemic control, we examined
      racial/ethnic differences in diabetes medication initiation during the year
      following diagnosis. METHODS: Among adults newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes
      (2005-2016), we examined how glucose-lowering medication initiation differed by
      race/ethnicity during the year following diagnosis. We specified modified Poisson
      regression models to estimate the association between race/ethnicity and
      medication initiation in the entire cohort and within subpopulations defined by
      HbA1c, BMI, age at diagnosis, comorbidity, and neighborhood deprivation index (a 
      census tract-level socioeconomic indicator). RESULTS: Among the 77,199 newly
      diagnosed individuals, 47% started a diabetes medication within 12 months of
      diagnosis. The prevalence of medication initiation ranged from 32% among Chinese 
      individuals to 58% among individuals of Other/Unknown races/ethnicities. Compared
      to White individuals, medication initiation was less likely among Chinese
      (relative risk: 0.78 (95% confidence interval 0.72, 0.84)) and Japanese (0.82
      (0.75, 0.90)) individuals, but was more likely among Hispanic/Latinx (1.27 (1.24,
      1.30)), African American (1.14 (1.11, 1.17)), other Asian (1.13 (1.08, 1.18)),
      South Asian (1.10 (1.04, 1.17)), Other/Unknown (1.31 (1.24, 1.39)), American
      Indian or Alaska Native (1.11 (1.04, 1.18)), and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander
      (1.28 (1.19, 1.37)) individuals. Racial/ethnic differences dissipated among
      individuals with higher HbA1c values. CONCLUSIONS: Initiation of glucose-lowering
      treatment during the year following type 2 diabetes diagnosis differed markedly
      by race/ethnicity, particularly for those with lower HbA1c values. Future
      research should examine how patient preferences, provider implicit bias, and
      shared decision-making contribute to these early treatment differences.

TI  - Association between central obesity and incident diabetes mellitus among
      Japanese: a retrospective cohort study using propensity score matching.
PG  - 13445
LID - 10.1038/s41598-022-17837-1 [doi]
AB  - Previous evidence revealed that central obesity played a vital role in the
      development of diabetes mellitus (DM). However, because of imbalanced confounding
      variables, some studies have not wholly established the association between
      central obesity and diabetes. Propensity score matching (PSM) analysis can
      minimize the impact of potential confounding variables. Therefore, the aim of the
      present study was to explore the relationship between central obesity and
      diabetes in the Japanese population by using PSM analysis. This retrospective
      cohort study included 15,453 Japanese adults who were free of diabetes at
      baseline between 2004 and 2015, which provided all medical records for
      individuals participating in the physical exam. Central obesity at baseline was
      an independent variable, and incident diabetes during follow-up was an outcome
      variable. Using a 1:1 PSM analysis, the present retrospective cohort study
      included 1639 adults with and without central obesity. Additionally, we employed 
      a doubly robust estimation method to identify the association between central
      obesity and diabetes. Subjects with central obesity were 92% more likely to
      develop DM (HR = 1.65, 95%CI 1.12, 2.41). After adjusting for covariates,
      subjects with central obesity had a 72% increased risk of developing DM compared 
      with subjects with non-central obesity in the PSM cohort (HR = 1.72, 95% CI 1.16,
      2.56). Central obesity individuals had a 91% higher risk of DM than non-central
      obesity individuals, after adjustment for propensity score (HR = 1.91, 95% CI
      1.29, 2.81). In sensitivity analysis, the central obesity group had a 44% (HR =
      1.44, 95% CI 1.09, 1.90) and 59% (HR = 1.59, 95% CI1.35, 1.88) higher risk of DM 
      than the non-central obesity group in the original and weighted cohorts after
      adjusting for confounding variables, respectively. Central obesity was
      independently associated with an increased risk of developing diabetes. After
      adjustment for confounding covariates, central obesity participants had a 72%
      higher risk of development of diabetes than non-central obesity individuals in
      the PSM cohort.

TI  - The impact of hypoglycaemia on quality of life among adults with type 1 diabetes:
      Results from "YourSAY: Hypoglycaemia".
PG  - 108232
LID - S1056-8727(22)00138-6 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jdiacomp.2022.108232 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Research on hypoglycaemia and quality of life (QoL) has focused mostly on
      severe hypoglycaemia and psychological outcomes, with less known about other
      aspects of hypoglycaemia (e.g., self-treated episodes) and impacts on other QoL
      domains (e.g., relationships). Therefore, we examined the impact of all aspects
      of hypoglycaemia on QoL in adults with type 1 diabetes (T1DM). METHODS:
      Participants completed an online survey, including assessment of
      hypoglycaemia-specific QoL (using the 12-item Hypoglycaemia Impact Profile).
      Mann-Whitney U tests examined differences in hypoglycaemia-specific QoL by
      hypoglycaemia frequency, severity, and awareness. Hierarchical linear regression 
      examined associations with QoL. RESULTS: Participants were 1028 adults with T1DM 
      (M +/- SD age: 47 +/- 15 years; diabetes duration: 27 +/- 16 years). Severe and
      self-treated hypoglycaemia and impaired awareness negatively impacted on overall 
      QoL and several QoL domains, including leisure activities, physical health,
      ability to keep fit/be active, sleep, emotional well-being, spontaneity,
      independence, work/studies, and dietary freedom. Diabetes distress was most
      strongly associated with hypoglycaemia-specific QoL, followed by generic
      emotional well-being, fear of hypoglycaemia, and confidence in managing
      hypoglycaemia. Hypoglycaemia frequency and awareness were no longer significantly
      associated with QoL once psychological factors were considered. CONCLUSIONS:
      Hypoglycaemia negatively impacts on several QoL domains. Psychological factors
      supersede the effect of hypoglycaemia frequency and awareness in accounting for
      this negative impact.

TI  - Diabesity in Adults With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: A Cross-sectional Study
      Exploring Self-care and Its Determinants.
LID - S1499-2671(22)00072-7 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jcjd.2022.03.009 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to describe self-care maintenance,
      self-care monitoring, self-care management and self-care self-efficacy in adults 
      with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and body mass index (BMI)<30 kg/m(2) and adults with 
      T2DM and BMI>/=30 kg/m(2) ("diabesity"), and to identify their clinical and
      sociodemographic determinants. Self-care is one of the main treatments for adults
      with T2DM. However, self-care has been poorly described in people with diabesity,
      and differences in clinical and sociodemographic determinants of self-care
      between patients with diabesity and patients with T2DM and BMI<30 kg/m(2) have,
      to our knowledge, not been assessed. METHODS: A secondary analysis was performed 
      of sociodemographic and clinical data using a multicentre, observational,
      cross-sectional design, wherein 540 adults diagnosed with T2DM were included in a
      consecutive and convenience sampling procedure. RESULTS: Self-care maintenance
      and management were significantly lower among patients with diabesity (p<0.001
      and p=0.025, respectively). Among patients with diabesity, low income (relative
      risk [RR]=3.27, p=0.01) and presence of diabetic neuropathy (RR=4.16; p=0.03)
      were strongly associated with inadequate self-care maintenance; completion of
      high school (RR=0.45; p=0.01), availability of a family caregiver (RR=0.52;
      p=0.04) and the use of insulin as the main treatment (RR=2.09; p=0.01) decreased 
      the likelihood of inadequate self-care monitoring. CONCLUSIONS: The unfavourable 
      behavioural profile of patients with diabesity could be further worsened by their
      lower level of confidence in performing adequate self-care.

TI  - Association of Atherogenic Index of Plasma With Retinopathy and Nephropathy in
      Adult Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Aged > 18 Years.

LID - 10.1016/j.jcjd.2022.04.008 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: In this study we assessed the atherogenic index of plasma (AIP) in
      relation to retinopathy and nephropathy in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus
      (T2DM). METHODS: In this cross-sectional study there were 4,358 inpatients with
      T2DM. The patients were divided into 4 groups: T2DM without complications (DM
      group), T2DM complicated with retinopathy alone and nephropathy alone (DR-alone
      and DN-alone groups) and T2DM complicated with both DR and DN (DRN group). AIP
      was calculated by the formula of log [triglyceride / high-density lipoprotein
      cholesterol]. RESULTS: AIPs in the DR-alone, DN-alone and DRN groups were
      significantly higher than in the DM group, with the DRN group having the highest 
      AIP level. Moreover, patients with proliferative DR had higher AIPs than patients
      with nonproliferative DR in the DR-alone and DRN groups, and patients with
      macroalbuminuria had higher AIPs than patients with microalbuminuria in DN-alone 
      and DRN groups. The highest AIP quartile group had the highest proportion of DRN 
      compared with the other quartile groups. The DRN group had a maximal area under
      the curve (AUC) for AIP on receiver operating characteristic curve analysis
      (AUC=0.735). In the subgroup analyses by age, the AUCs of patients <65 years of
      age were all greater than those of patients >/=65 years of age. Logistic
      regression analysis showed that AIP had the highest correlation with age <65
      years in individuals with DRN, and this association remained significant after
      adjustment with 3 models. CONCLUSIONS: AIP is positively associated with both
      occurrence and severity of diabetic microvascular complications. It can predict
      their presence in T2DM, especially in those <65 years of age with DRN.

TI  - Association Between Antidepressant Use and Adherence to Anti-hyperglycemic
      Medications in Adults With Type 2 Diabetes and Depression: A Retrospective Cohort
      Study.
LID - S1499-2671(22)00065-X [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jcjd.2022.03.002 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Depression is a known risk factor for poor medication adherence, but 
      it is unclear whether depression treatment affects adherence rates. In this
      study, we examined the association between pharmacologic treatment of a new
      depressive episode and subsequent adherence to oral anti-hyperglycemic
      medications. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study we used administrative
      health data to follow adult new metformin users in Alberta, Canada, between 2008 
      and 2018. Depressive episodes starting >/=1 year after metformin initiation were 
      identified and individuals starting antidepressant treatment within the first 90 
      days were compared with those who did not. The proportion of days covered (PDC)
      with oral anti-hyperglycemic medications in the subsequent year (days 91 to 455) 
      was used to estimate adherence. The association between antidepressant treatment 
      and poor adherence (PDC<0.8) was examined using multivariate logistic regression 
      models. RESULTS: A new depressive episode occurred in 6,201 people, with a mean
      age of 56.0 (standard deviation [SD], 15.4) years. Of this cohort, 3,303 (53.2%) 
      were women. Mean PDC was 0.55 (SD, 0.41); 924 (57.0%) of 1,621 people who started
      antidepressant treatment and 2,709 (59.2%) of 4,580 controls had poor adherence
      (p=0.13). After adjusting for baseline comorbidities and other characteristics,
      antidepressant treatment was associated with a lower likelihood of poor adherence
      (adjusted odds ratio, 0.85; 95% confidence interval, 0.75 to 0.96; p=0.007).
      CONCLUSIONS: Although overall adherence to anti-hyperglycemic medications was low
      after onset of a depressive episode, antidepressant treatment was associated with
      a lower likelihood of poor adherence.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Although culturally tailored diabetes treatment is recommended, there
      is a lack of relevant dietary resources for the Chinese population in Canada. In 
      this study we assessed the feasibility and efficacy of a culturally tailored menu
      plan combined with nutrition education on clinical outcomes, diet quality and
      qualitative outcomes among Chinese immigrants with type 2 diabetes. METHODS:
      Participants were 17 Chinese immigrants living with type 2 diabetes in Edmonton, 
      Alberta, Canada. The design was a 12-week, single-arm intervention that included 
      weekly nutrition education supported by a culturally tailored menu plan with
      mixed methods evaluation. Diet quality, clinical and other outcomes were assessed
      pre- and postintervention. One-on-one interviews were conducted postintervention 
      to identify program feasibility and obstacles to adherence. RESULTS: Waist
      circumference (mean +/- standard deviation: -2.0+/-2.5 cm; p=0.004), total
      cholesterol (-21.4+/-28.2 mg/dL; p=0.007) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol
      (-18.4+/-24.6 mg/dL; p=0.007) were decreased when compared with baseline. No
      significant change was detected in glycated hemoglobin. Postintervention, the
      Healthy Eating Index (p=0.01) and diabetes knowledge score (p=0.009) also
      increased. Participants reported that the program was culturally acceptable,
      easily understood and feasible to implement. Participants indicated the program
      helped them to improve their diabetes knowledge, adhere to the dietary
      guidelines, choose low glycemic index food and read food labels when shopping.
      CONCLUSIONS: A flexible, culturally tailored menu plan was a feasible and
      effective tool for improving diabetes knowledge, diet quality and metabolic
      outcomes among Chinese immigrants with type 2 diabetes.

TI  - Managing the unmanageable through interdependence in adolescents living with type
      1 diabetes and their parents: A constructivist grounded theory.

LID - 10.1016/j.pedn.2022.07.016 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Management of T1D is complex and requires continuous care and
      monitoring that place many demands on adolescents with T1D and their parents. The
      purpose of this study was to explore the nature of interdependence with T1D
      management with adolescents and their parents. METHODS: Using a constructivist
      grounded theory methodology, 32 open-ended interviews were conducted,
      transcribed, and analyzed from 11 adolescents aged 10-18 years with T1D and eight
      parents. FINDINGS: The data were coded using three coding phases: initial,
      focused, and theroetical and this process continued until theroetical saturation 
      was reached. The substantive theory that emerged from the data describing
      parents' and adolescents' main concern of Maintaining Optimal Glycemic Control
      was Managing the Unmanageable through Interdependence. Four related subprocesses 
      were found: Completing T1D Tasks, Attaining Support, Balancing Independence, and 
      Reconciling Reality. These subprocesses occurred within the context of the
      ever-changing, Nature of the Illness. DISCUSSION: There is a dynamic relationship
      associated with interdependence between adolescents with T1D and their parents
      that varied situationally and by age. Participants also indicated interdependence
      occurs or they would like it to occur, with others beyond themselves and the
      health-care team to others willing to be involved. APPLICATION TO PRACTICE:
      Interdependence is a dynamic process and requires ongoing evaluation by
      health-care professionals of its function in the daily management of T1D by
      parents and adolescents. Additional research into of the roles of health
      professionals and others in promoting interdependence is needed.

AB  - Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a serious public health problem. In this
      review, we discuss current and promising future drugs, targets, in vitro assays
      and emerging omics technologies in T2DM. Importantly, we open the perspective to 
      image-based high-content screening (HCS), with the focus of combining it with
      metabolomics or lipidomics. HCS has become a strong technology in phenotypic
      screens because it allows comprehensive screening for the cell-modulatory
      activity of small molecules. Metabolomics and lipidomics screen for perturbations
      at the molecular level. The combination of these data-intensive comprehensive
      technologies is enabled by the rapid development of artificial intelligence. It
      promises a deep cellular and molecular phenotyping directly linked to chemical
      information about the applied drug candidates or complex mixtures.

AB  - Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease resulting from the demolition of
      beta-cells that are responsible for producing insulin in the pancreas. Treatment 
      with insulin (lifelong applying) and islet transplantation (in rare cases and
      severe diseases), are standards of care for T1D. Pancreas or islet
      transplantation have some limitations, such as lack of sufficient donors and
      longtime immune suppression for preventing allograft rejection. Recent studies
      demonstrate that autologous hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) can regenerate immune 
      tolerance against auto-antigens. Taking advantage of this feature, autologous HSC
      transplantation (auto-HSCT) is likely the only treatment for T1D that is
      associated with lasting and complete remission. None of the other evaluated
      immunotherapies worldwide had the clinical efficacy of auto-HSCT. Therapy with
      auto-HSCT is insulin-independent rather than reducing insulin needs or delaying
      loss of insulin production. This review provided the latest findings in auto-HSCT
      for treatment of T1D.

LID - 10.1016/j.cca.2022.07.017 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a well-established risk factor for
      cardiovascular diseases. We aimed to identify the biological variation of ten
      cardiovascular biochemical markers in T2DM patients to aid in their
      interpretation. METHODS: Blood samples for evaluating ten biomarkers were
      collected biweekly from 23 T2DM patients (10 men, 13 women) for three months. The
      analytical variability and variations of within-subject (CVI) and between-subject
      (CVG) levels were calculated, as well as the analytical performance
      specifications, reference change value (RCV), and index of individuality (II).
      RESULTS: The levels of total cholesterol (CHOL), apolipoprotein A (apoA),
      homocysteine (HCY), high-sensitivity troponin T (hsTnT) and N-terminal pro-brain 
      natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) differed between males and females (P<0.05). The 
      CVIs or CVGs of the biomakers were higher than those of healthy participants in
      Westgard online database, except for hsTnT. Triglyceride (TG), lipoprotein (a)
      [Lp(a)] and NT-proBNP had relatively high CVI, CVG and RCV, whereas CHOL,
      high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), apoA and HCY showed low variation. 
      Moreover, the II of HDL-C, LP(a), apoA, HCY and hsTnT was <0.6 and other
      biochemical markers was between 0.6 and 1.4. CONCLUSION: The cardiovascular
      biochemical markers in T2DM patients showed higher CVI or CVG, except for hsTnT. 
      ApoA had the lowest CVI and CVG values. Population-based reference intervals
      should be used with caution in clinical decision-making for T2DM patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We sought to describe global patterns in achievement of risk factor
      control for primary prevention in patients with T2D and explore the association
      of country's GNI/capita with risk factor control. METHODS: The DISCOVER study is 
      a prospective, observational study of patients with T2D from 38 countries
      enrolled at initiation of second-line glucose-lowering therapy. We examined
      achievement of risk factor control (glycosylated hemoglobin <7%, blood pressure
      <140/90 mmHg, prescription of a statin) at 3 years among those without optimal
      control at baseline. Countries were stratified by gross national income
      (GNI)/capita, from 2017). We examined the impact of country GNI/capita with
      achievement of risk factor control. FINDINGS: Our cohort included 9613 patients
      with T2D and without baseline cardiovascular disease (mean age 57.2 +/- 8.7
      years, 47.9% women). At baseline, 6354/7646 patients (83.1%) had suboptimal
      glucose control, 3449/9200 patients (37.5%) had suboptimal BP control, and
      2800/4221 patients (66.7%) were not on an appropriate statin (sample sizes
      differed due to missing covariate data). Optimal control at 3 years of follow-up 
      was achieved in 41% (glucose), 56% (blood pressure), and 29% (statins) of
      patients. There was significant variability in achievement of risk factor control
      across countries but no association between country GNI/capita with achievement
      of risk factor control (p>0.08 for all). INTERPRETATION: In a global, prospective
      study of patients with T2D, we found that cardiovascular risk factor control
      achievement was suboptimal despite 3 years of follow-up in specialized health
      care systems. Neither country-level nor patient-level socioeconomic factors fully
      explained this finding.

AB  - AIMS: To assess associations that endogenous estradiol and testosterone levels
      have with cognitive function in older adults with Type 2 diabetes mellitus
      (T2DM). METHODS: We use data from the Look AHEAD clinical trial of behavioral
      weight loss. Endogenous estradiol and total testosterone levels were determined
      using stored serum from 996 individuals, mean age 69 years, at two times
      (averaging 4 years apart) during years 8-18 of follow-up. One to four
      standardized assessments of attention, executive function, memory, and verbal
      fluency were collected during this follow-up. Mixed effects models and multiple
      imputation were used to assess associations that estradiol and total testosterone
      levels had with body mass index and cognitive function. RESULTS: Estradiol levels
      were not associated with cognitive function in either sex. Total testosterone
      levels were not associated with cognitive function in women, but greater total
      testosterone levels were associated with better verbal fluency in men (p <
      0.001), most strongly among those carrying the APOE-e4 allele (interaction p =
      0.02). The weight loss intervention left a legacy of relatively lower cognitive
      functioning among women, which was not mediated by current levels of sex
      hormones. CONCLUSIONS: Behavioral weight loss intervention does not affect
      cognitive functioning through mechanisms related to estradiol or testosterone.

TI  - Evolution of Clinical Complexity, Treatment Burden, Health Care Use, and
      Diabetes-Related Outcomes Among Commercial and Medicare Advantage Plan
      Beneficiaries With Diabetes in the U.S., 2006-2018.
LID - dc212623 [pii]
LID - 10.2337/dc21-2623 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To characterize trends in clinical complexity, treatment burden,
      health care use, and diabetes-related outcomes among adults with diabetes.
      RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We used a nationwide claims database to identify
      enrollees in commercial and Medicare Advantage plans who met claims criteria for 
      diabetes between 1 January 2006 and 31 March 2019 and to quantify annual trends
      in clinical complexity (e.g., active health conditions), treatment burden (e.g., 
      medications), health care use (e.g., ambulatory, emergency department [ED], and
      hospital visits), and diabetes-related outcomes (e.g., hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c]
      levels) between 2006 and 2018. RESULTS: Among 1,470,799 commercially insured
      patients, the proportion with >/=10 active health conditions increased from 33.3%
      (95% CI 33.1-33.4) in 2006 to 38.9% (38.8-39.1) in 2018 (P = 0.001) and the
      proportion taking three or more glucose-lowering medications increased from 11.6%
      (11.5-11.7) to 23.1% (22.9-23.2) (P = 0.007). The proportion with HbA1c >/=8.0%
      (>/=64 mmol/mol) increased from 28.0% (27.7-28.3) in 2006 to 30.5% (30.2-30.7) in
      2015, decreasing to 27.8% (27.5-28.0) in 2018 (overall trend P = 0.04). Number of
      ambulatory visits per patient per year decreased from 6.86 (6.84-6.88) to 6.19
      (6.17-6.21), (P = 0.001) while ED visits increased from 0.26 (0.257-0.263) to
      0.29 (0.287-0.293) (P = 0.001). Among 1,311,903 Medicare Advantage enrollees, the
      proportion with >/=10 active conditions increased from 51.6% (51.2-52.0) to 65.1%
      (65.0-65.2) (P < 0.001); the proportion taking three or more glucose-lowering
      medications was stable at 16.6% (16.3-16.9) and 18.1% (18.0-18.2) (P = 0.98), and
      the proportion with HbA1c >/=8.0% increased from 17.4% (16.7-18.1) to 18.6%
      (18.4-18.7) (P = 0.008). Ambulatory visits per patient per year remained stable
      at 8.01 (7.96-8.06) and 8.17 (8.16-8.19) (P = 0.23), but ED visits increased from
      0.41 (0.40-0.42) to 0.66 (0.66-0.66) (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Among patients
      with diabetes, clinical complexity and treatment burden have increased over time.
      ED utilization has also increased, and patients may be using ED services for low 
      acuity conditions.

TI  - Plasma exosomal microRNAs Associated with Metabolism as Early Predictor of
      Gestational Diabetes Mellitus.
LID - db210909 [pii]
LID - 10.2337/db21-0909 [doi]
AB  - To date, the microRNA (miRNA) expression profile of plasma exosomes in women
      whose pregnancy is complicated by gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) has not
      been fully clarified. In this study, differentially expressed miRNAs in plasma
      exosomes were identified by high-throughput small RNA sequencing in 12 GDM and 12
      normal glucose tolerance (NGT) pregnant women and validated in 102 GDM and 101
      NGT pregnant women. A total of 22 exosomal miRNAs were found and five of them
      were verified by qRT-PCR. Exosmal miR-423-5p was upregulated, while miR-122-5p,
      miR-148a-3p, miR-192-5p, and miR-99a-5p were downregulated in women whose
      pregnancy is complicated by GDM. IGF1R and GYS1 as target genes of miR-423-5p,
      and G6PC3 and FDFT1 as target genes of miR-122-5p, were associated with insulin
      and AMPK signaling pathways and may participate in the regulation of metabolism
      in GDM. The five exosomal miRNAs showed an AUC of 0.82 (95%CI, 0.73 approximately
      0.91) in early prediction of GDM. Our study demonstrated that dysregulated
      exosomal miRNAs in plasma from GDM pregnant women might influence the insulin and
      AMPK signaling pathways and could contribute to the early prediction of GDM.

TI  - Glycated haemoglobin and fasting plasma glucose tests in the screening of
      outpatients for diabetes and abnormal glucose regulation in Uganda: A diagnostic 
      accuracy study.
PG  - e0272515
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0272515 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: To understand the utility of glycated haemoglobin
      (HBA1C) in screening for diabetes and Abnormal Glucose Regulation (AGR) in
      primary care, we compared its performance to that of the fasting plasma glucose
      (FPG) test. METHODS: This was a prospective diagnostic accuracy study conducted
      in eastern Uganda. Patients eligible for inclusion were consecutive adults, 30-75
      years, receiving care at the outpatient department of a general hospital in
      eastern Uganda. We determined the sensitivity, specificity and optimum cut-off
      points for HBA1C and FPG tests using the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) as a 
      clinical reference standard. RESULTS: A total of 1659 participants underwent FPG 
      testing of whom 310 were also HBA1C and OGTT tested. A total of 113 tested
      positive for diabetes and 168 for AGR on the OGTT. At recommended cut-off points 
      for diabetes, the HBA1C and FPG tests had comparable sensitivity [69.8% (95% CI
      46.3-86.1) versus 62.6% (95% CI 41.5-79.8), respectively] and specificity [98.6% 
      (95% CI 95.4-99.6) versus 99.4% (95% CI 98.9-99.7), respectively]. Similarly, the
      sensitivity of HBA1C and the FPG tests for Abnormal Glucose Regulation (AGR) at
      ADA cut-offs were comparable [58.9% (95% CI 46.7-70.2) vs 47.7% (95% CI
      37.3-58.4), respectively]; however, the HBA1C test had lower specificity [70.7%
      (95% CI 65.1-75.8)] than the FPG test [93.5% (95% CI 88.6-96.4)]. At the optimum 
      cut-offs points for diabetes [45.0 mmol/mol (6.3%) for HBA1C and 6.4 mmol/L
      (115.2 mg/dl) for FPG], HBA1C and FPG sensitivity [71.2% (95% CI 46.9-87.8)
      versus 72.7% (95% CI 49.5-87.8), respectively] and specificity [95.1% (95% CI91.8
      97.2) versus 98.7% (95% CI 98.0 99.2), respectively] were comparable. Similarly, 
      at the optimum cut-off points for AGR [42.0 mmol/mol (6.0%) for the HBA1C and 5.5
      mmol/l (99.0 mg/dl) for the FPG test], HBA1C and FPG sensitivity [42.3% (95% CI
      31.8-53.6) and 53.2 (95% CI 43.1-63.1), respectively] and specificity [89.1% (95%
      CI 84.1 92.7) and 92.7% (95% CI 91.0 94.1), respectively] were comparable.
      DISCUSSION: HBA1C is a viable alternative diabetes screening and confirmatory
      test to the FPG test; however, the utility of both tests in screening for
      prediabetes in this outpatient population is limited.

TI  - Lifestyle habits in Saudi adolescents with diagnosed diabetes: An opportunity for
      health promotion.
PG  - e0270807
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0270807 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: This study assessed lifestyle and health behavior habits among a
      representative sample of Saudi adolescents with self-reported diabetes and
      compared them to non-diabetic peers. METHODS: This was a nested case-control
      study, from the Jeeluna cohort, a nationwide, cross-sectional study of 12,575
      Saudi boys and girls aged 10-19 years. Non-diabetic adolescents were matched to
      those with diabetes on a ratio of 4:1 based on age, gender and region. Retained
      information from the original study included: socio-demographics, lifestyle
      behaviors, tobacco/substance use, screen use, anthropometric measurements, and
      laboratory results. RESULTS: The prevalence of diabetes was 0.7% (n = 87).
      Overall, 65% of diabetic participants were males, and 22.4% aged </=14 years.
      Overall, both groups had low rates of healthful habits in their diet and physical
      activity. Both groups had similar rates of tobacco use, and high digital screen
      time. Adolescents with diabetes had more consistent sleeping pattern, were more
      likely to be on a diet, thought they spent enough time with their physician and
      obtained medical information more often from their health clinic. They were also 
      more likely to feel down and to chat more often. CONCLUSION: Adolescents with
      diabetes remain far from guideline targets but seem predisposed to better
      lifestyle and have more access to health as compared to their non-diabetic peers.

TI  - Immune cells and their inflammatory mediators modify beta cells and cause
      checkpoint inhibitor-induced diabetes.
LID - 10.1172/jci.insight.156330 [doi]
LID - e156330 [pii]
AB  - Checkpoint inhibitors (CPIs) targeting programmed death-1(PD-1)/programmed
      death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) have
      revolutionized cancer treatment but can trigger autoimmune complications
      including CPI-induced diabetes (CPI-DM), which occurs preferentially with PD-1
      blockade. We found evidence of pancreatic inflammation in patients with CPI-DM
      with shrinkage of pancreases, increased pancreatic enzymes, and in a case from a 
      patient who died with CPI-DM, peri-islet lymphocytic infiltration. In the NOD
      mouse model, anti-PD-L1 but not anti-CTLA-4 induces diabetes rapidly. RNA
      sequencing revealed that cytolytic IFNgamma+ CD8+ T cells infiltrated islets with
      anti-PD-L1. Changes in beta cells were predominantly driven by IFNgamma and
      TNFalpha and included induction of a potentially novel beta cell population with 
      transcriptional changes suggesting dedifferentiation. IFNgamma increased
      checkpoint ligand expression and activated apoptosis pathways in human beta cells
      in vitro. Treatment with anti-IFNgamma and anti-TNFalpha prevented CPI-DM in
      anti-PD-L1 treated NOD mice. CPIs targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway result in
      transcriptional changes in beta cells and immune infiltrates that may lead to the
      development of diabetes. Inhibition of inflammatory cytokines can prevent CPI-DM,
      suggesting a strategy for clinical application to prevent this complication.

TI  - Evaluation of type 2 diabetes care management in nine primary care practices
      before and after implementation of the Criteria of Good Disease Management of
      Diabetes established by the Swiss Society of Endocrinology and Diabetology.

AB  - AIMS OF THE STUDY: Little is known about the quality of diabetes management of
      patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in Swiss primary care. Based on the
      recommendations of the National Council Quality Assurance Programme, an
      interprofessional working group of the Swiss Society of Endocrinology and
      Diabetology (SSED) established population-based national criteria for good
      disease management of T2DM in primary health care (the diabetes score). The
      objective of this study was to assess whether the implementation of these
      criteria improve diabetes management in primary care. METHODS: The diabetes score
      comprises eight criteria including three biometric measurements, two
      lifestyle-specific items and screening of three diabetes-associated
      complications. Practices can evaluate adherence to the criteria based on a point 
      system, with the recommended aim to achieve >/=70/100 points. Group practices and
      single practices were included in this study and started implementing the SSED
      criteria in January 2018. The resulting score was compared with data
      retrospectively obtained for 2017. The primary endpoint was the overall change in
      Diabetes Score between 2017 and 2018 at each practice, further stratified by
      practice type. The absolute effect on individual diabetes score criteria was
      assessed by pooling all patient-level data. RESULTS: Nine practices (six single
      and three group) participated in the study. In 2017 and 2018, the primary care
      practices treated 727 and 704 patients with T2DM, respectively, of whom 676 were 
      treated both years. Around half of the patients were cared for in group practices
      and half in single practices. Between 2017 and 2018 the median (interquartile
      range) diabetes score improved from 40 (35, 65) to 55 (45, 70; p = 0.078). One
      practice (single) obtained a score >/=70 in 2017, three practices (all single)
      achieved this target in 2018. Pooling patient-level data, we observed a
      significant absolute improvement in the following criteria: number of regular
      diabetes check ups, body mass index, glycated haemoglobin, blood pressure, low
      density lipoprotein cholesterol and screenings for diabetes-associated
      complications (all p <0.05). However, the extent of the improvements were often
      insufficient to reach the prefixed targets of the diabetes score criteria on the 
      practice level. CONCLUSION: Overall, the implementation of the SSED criteria in
      the current setting led to a modest, nonsignificant improvement of the diabetes
      score. Only three (all single practices) out of the nine practices reached the
      recommended 70-point target, indicating that further strategies are needed to
      improve diabetes care in primary care practice. Trial registration:

TI  - Division of Type 1 Diabetes Responsibility in Latinx and Non-Latinx White
      Mother-Adolescent Dyads.
LID - 10.1007/s10865-022-00311-8 [doi]
AB  - Incidence rates of type 1 diabetes are increasing faster in Latinx youth than
      other ethnic groups, yet this population remains understudied. The current study 
      (1) tested differences in division of diabetes-related responsibility (adolescent
      alone, mother alone, and shared) across Latinx and non-Latinx White families (N =
      118 mother-adolescent dyads, 56 = Latinx dyads, Mage=13.24 years), and (2)
      examined associations between diabetes responsibility and adolescent health
      (HbA1c, diabetes self-management behaviors, and depressive symptoms). Latina
      mothers reported more shared and less adolescent responsibility than non-Latinx
      White mothers, but there were no ethnic differences in adolescent reports of
      responsibility. Independent of demographic and illness-related characteristics,
      mother- and adolescent-reports of shared responsibility were associated with
      higher self-management behaviors, while individual responsibility (adolescent or 
      mother alone) was generally associated with lower self-management behaviors.
      Shared responsibility associations with higher mother-reported self-management
      behaviors occurred among Latinx families, but not non-Latinx White families.
      Shared and individual responsibility were not associated with HbA1c or depressive
      symptoms. The findings suggest the importance of shared responsibility for
      diabetes management in adolescence, particularly in Latinx families.

TI  - Research for correlation between heart rate variability parameters and bone
      mineral density in patients of type 2 diabetes mellitus.
LID - 10.1007/s40618-022-01886-4 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The relationship of CAN and BMD, fracture risk is still unclear in T2DM.
      The aim of the present study is to investigate the correlation between heart rate
      variability (HRV) and BMD in T2DM. METHODS: The study included 276 patients with 
      T2DM aged >/= 50 years, and Cardiovascular Autonomic Reflex Tests (CARTs) were
      applied to divide patients into two groups: CAN ( +/-). 24 h Ambulatory ECG was
      assessed for HRV, BMD was measured by dual-energy X-ray bone densitometry, and
      FRAX scores were calculated for 10-year hip fracture risk (HF(1)) and major
      osteoporotic fracture risk (MOF). Adjusted regression analysis was performed to
      investigate influence factors for BMD and fracture risk. ROC curve was used to
      analyze the optimal cut-off point of LF/HF for screening osteoporosis. RESULTS:
      Baseline data showed significant differences in the duration of T2DM, insulin
      resistance index (HOMA-IR), 25-hydroxyvitamin D[25(OH)D], femoral neck BMD, hip
      BMD, lumbar BMD, HF(1), and MOF between the CAN ( +) and CAN (-) groups. The
      proportion of patients with osteoporosis increased as the degree of CAN lesion
      increased. Correlation analysis showed that LF/HF was significantly correlated
      with BMD, especially with hip (r = - 0.534, p < 0.001). Regression analysis
      showed that LF/HF was a risk factor for reduced BMD and increased fracture risk. 
      The optimal cut-point value for LF/HF to predict osteoporosis by ROC curve
      analysis was 3.17. CONCLUSIONS: CAN is associated with reduced BMD and increased 
      fracture risk in patients with T2DM, and LF/HF may have the potential to be a
      predictor of diabetic osteoporosis and have some clinical value in early
      diagnosis of diabetic osteoporosis and non-traumatic fractures in T2DM.

TI  - SGLT2 inhibitors in type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis of
      cardiovascular outcome trials balancing their risks and benefits.
LID - 10.1007/s00125-022-05773-8 [doi]
AB  - AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOTs) have demonstrated the
      benefits of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i). However, serious 
      adverse drug reactions have been reported. The risk/benefit ratio of SGLT2i
      remains unquantified. We aimed to provide an estimation of their risk/benefit
      ratio in individuals with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: We conducted a systematic
      review (MEDLINE, up to 14 September 2021) and meta-analysis. We included
      randomised CVOTs assessing SGLT2i in individuals with type 2 diabetes with or
      without other diseases. We used the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' assessment tool. The 
      primary outcomes were overall mortality, major adverse cardiovascular events
      (MACE), hospitalisation for heart failure (HHF), end-stage renal disease (ESRD), 
      amputation, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and reported genital infections. For each
      outcome, we estimated the incidence rate ratio (IRR) with a 95% CI; we then
      computed the number of events expected spontaneously and with SGLT2i. RESULTS: A 
      total of 46,969 participants from five double-blind, placebo-controlled
      international trials (weighted mean follow-up 3.5 years) were included. The
      prevalence of previous CVD ranged from 40.6% to 99.2%. The definition of reported
      genital infections ranged from 'genital mycotic infection' to 'genital infections
      that led to discontinuation of the trial regimen or were considered to be serious
      adverse events'. The number of included studies for each outcomes was five. The
      use of SGLT2i decreased the risk of all-cause death (IRR 0.86 [95% CI 0.78,
      0.95]), MACE (IRR 0.91 [95% CI 0.86, 0.96]), HHF (IRR 0.69 [95% CI 0.62, 0.76])
      and ESRD (IRR 0.67 [95% CI 0.53, 0.84]), and increased the risk of DKA (IRR 2.59 
      [95% CI 1.57, 4.27]) and genital infection (IRR 3.50 [95% CI 3.09, 3.95]) but not
      of amputation (IRR 1.23 [95% CI 1.00, 1.51]). For 1000 individuals treated over
      3.5 years, SGLT2i are expected, on average, to decrease the number of deaths from
      70 to 61, to prevent nine MACE, 11 HHF and two cases of ESRD, while inducing two 
      DKA occurrences and 36 genital infections; 778 individuals are expected to avoid 
      all the following outcomes: MACE, HHF, ESRD, amputation, DKA and genital
      infection. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our study is limited to aggregate data. In
      a population of individuals with type 2 diabetes and a high CVD risk, the
      cardiovascular and renal benefits of SGLT2i remain substantial despite the risk
      of DKA and even the hypothetical risk of amputation. TRIAL REGISTRATION: OSF

TI  - Nurses' role in diabetes management and prevention in community care.
PG  - 374-376
LID - 10.12968/bjcn.2022.27.8.374 [doi]
AB  - Diabetes care-particularly in a community setting as a form of prevention and
      management, is a growing requirement across England and Ireland. Self-management 
      skills are an essential part of diabetes management and nurses in the community
      setting are one of the first points of care to ensure this. It is therefore
      imperative that nurses working within these primary and community care settings
      have the knowledge and skills necessary to support those in the community setting
      to effectively manage their condition, improve their health outcomes and their
      quality of life. Primary care has been tasked with providing both routine and
      more complex diabetes care and highlights a risk of adverse outcomes if people
      with diabetes are transferred to general practices without adequate support.
      Developing an approach for effective and efficient joint collaboration for
      primary care and specialists to manage the population of people with diabetes
      under their care is vital in its prevention and management. So how can this be
      achieved and what resources are required? This article will discuss current
      research into clinical practice and pilots which can contribute to supporting a
      more holistic multi-disciplinary approach to diabetes management and prevention, 
      and hence, a provision of community based services aimed at health prevention.

AB  - The present study conducted a latent profile analysis from a US national sample
      of 446 family members to identify and predict unique clusters of family members' 
      PWD illness appraisals, involvement, and psychological distress. Time since
      diagnosis, diabetes adherence, the relationship with the PWD, age, gender,
      race/ethnicity, income, and economic pressure were included as predictors. Class 
      membership was used to predict the family members' own health behaviors (sleep
      quality, days of physical activity, and diet quality). Results revealed four
      distinct classes: Moderately Concerned, Involved, and Distressed (32.51%), Least 
      Concerned, Distressed, and Involved (27.13%), Less Concerned and Distressed,
      Moderately Involved (23.77%), and Most Concerned, Involved, and Distressed
      (16.82%). The significant predictors and outcomes of class membership revealed
      interesting patterns in associations with class membership. Consequently, in
      addition to involving family members, health promotion and intervention efforts
      must consider the psychological health and illness appraisals of family members
      rather than a one-size-fits-all approach.

TI  - Fingerstick glucose monitoring by cognitive impairment status in Veterans Affairs
      nursing home residents with diabetes.
LID - 10.1111/jgs.17962 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Guidelines recommend nursing home (NH) residents with cognitive
      impairment receive less intensive glycemic treatment and less frequent
      fingerstick monitoring. Our objective was to determine whether current practice
      aligns with guideline recommendations by examining fingerstick frequency in
      Veterans Affairs (VA) NH residents with diabetes across cognitive impairment
      levels. METHODS: We identified VA NH residents with diabetes aged >/=65 residing 
      in VA NHs for >30 days between 2016 and 2019. Residents were grouped by cognitive
      impairment status based on the Cognitive Function Scale: cognitively intact, mild
      impairment, moderate impairment, and severe impairment. We also categorized
      residents into mutually exclusive glucose-lowering medication (GLM) categories:
      (1) no GLMs, (2) metformin only, (3) sulfonylureas/other GLMs (+/- metformin but 
      no insulin), (4) long-acting insulin (+/- oral/other GLMs but no short-acting
      insulin), and (5) any short-acting insulin. Our outcome was mean daily
      fingersticks on day 31 of NH admission. RESULTS: Among 13,637 NH residents, mean 
      age was 75 years and mean hemoglobin A1c was 7.0%. The percentage of NH residents
      on short-acting insulin varied by cognitive status from 22.7% in residents with
      severe cognitive impairment to 33.9% in residents who were cognitively intact.
      Mean daily fingersticks overall on day 31 was 1.50 (standard deviation = 1.73).
      There was a greater range in mean fingersticks across GLM categories compared to 
      cognitive status. Fingersticks ranged widely across GLM categories from 0.39 per 
      day (no GLMs) to 3.08 (short-acting insulin), while fingersticks ranged slightly 
      across levels of cognitive impairment from 1.11 (severe cognitive impairment) to 
      1.59 (cognitively intact). CONCLUSION: NH residents receive frequent fingersticks
      regardless of level of cognitive impairment, suggesting that cognitive status is 
      a minor consideration in monitoring decisions. Future studies should determine
      whether decreasing fingersticks in NH residents with moderate/severe cognitive
      impairment can reduce burdens without compromising safety.

TI  - Down-regulation of circCOL1A2 suppresses the dysfunction of diabetes-related
      retinal microvascular endothelial cells via miR-646/FGF7 axis.
PG  - 1-12
LID - 10.1080/02713683.2022.2110264 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Diabetic retinopathy (DR), the major complication of diabetes, is the
      leading cause of vision loss and blindness globally. Altered circular RNAs
      (circRNAs) expression has been found to be involved in DR process. Hence, this
      work aimed to explore the role and mechanism of circCOL1A2 in DR. METHODS: Human 
      retinal microvascular endothelial cells (RMECs) treated with high glucose (HG)
      were used for functional analysis. Levels of genes and proteins were detected
      using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. In
      vitro experiments were conducted by transwell, tube formation, CCK-8 assays, and 
      ELISA, respectively. The binding interaction between miR-646 and circCOL1A2 or
      FGF7 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 7) was confirmed using dual-luciferase reporter
      and RIP assays. RESULTS: CircCOL1A2 was highly expressed in retinal tissues of DR
      patients and HG-induced RMECs. Then RMECs were exposed to HG treatment to mimic
      the diabetic conditions in vitro. Functionally, circCOL1A2 knockdown attenuated
      HG-evoked RMEC migration, proliferation, angiogenesis, blood-retina barrier (BRB)
      injury and inflammation. Mechanistically, circCOL1A2 functioned as a sponge for
      miR-646, and miR-646 directly targeted FGF7. Further rescue experiments showed
      that miR-646 inhibition abated the protective effects of circCOL1A2 knockdown on 
      RMEC function under HG treatment. Besides that, miR-646 was decreased in
      HG-induced RMECs, re-expression of miR-646 reversed HG-evoked RMEC dysfunction,
      which was rescued by FGF7 overexpression. CONCLUSION: CircCOL1A2 silencing can
      suppress HG-induced migration, proliferation, angiogenesis, BRB injury and
      inflammation in RMECs through miR-646/FGF7 axis, suggesting the potential
      involvement of circCOL1A2 in DR process.

TI  - Experiences and needs of Saudi mothers when a child or adolescent is diagnosed
      with type 1 diabetes mellitus: a qualitative study.
PG  - 2107151
LID - 10.1080/17482631.2022.2107151 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To explore the experiences of Saudi mothers with children or adolescents who
      have Type 1 diabetes mellitus at time of diagnosis. BACKGROUND: The Kingdom of
      Saudi Arabia (KSA) has one of the highest incidence rates of Type 1 diabetes
      mellitus in children and adolescents in the world. Few studies have considered
      the most appropriate methods of support for parents in the KSA and none report
      the experiences of Saudi mothers. DESIGN: Phenomenological inquiry. METHOD:
      Qualitative interviews were conducted with 11 Saudi mothers and data were
      analysed following Giorgi's 5-step method. RESULTS: The lived experiences of
      Saudi mothers coalesced around three overarching themes and eight subthemes: 1.
      In the dark (mother's instinct, challenges of diagnosis phase, cultural
      reflections); 2. Empowerment (methods of support, mother's health and wellbeing);
      3. Coping and acceptance (stigma and cultural perceptions, coping strategies,
      transformation and adaptation). CONCLUSIONS: Effective interventions delivered in
      other countries to support mothers may be effective in the KSA. However, the
      central role that Saudi mothers play in the management of their child's
      condition, and the place of Islam in Saudi society, indicate the need for
      customized methods of support that take into account psychosociocultural needs of
      both mother and child.

TI  - A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Total Ankle Arthroplasty or Ankle
      Arthrodesis for Treatment of Osteoarthritis in Patients With Diabetes.
PG  - 24730114221112955
LID - 10.1177/24730114221112955 [doi]
AB  - Background: End-stage ankle osteoarthritis often requires one of 2 major surgical
      procedures: total ankle arthroplasty or ankle arthrodesis. Although the gold
      standard has been arthrodesis, patients with diabetes represent a unique cohort
      that requires additional considerations because of their decreased mobility and
      risk factors for cardiovascular complications. The purpose of this study is to
      review odds of major and minor adverse events for patients with diabetes and
      patients without diabetes in both total ankle arthroplasty and ankle arthrodesis.
      Methods: A total of 14 articles published between 2010 and 2020 were included in 
      this review. Databases included PubMed, Scopus, MEDLINE/Embase, and Cochrane
      Library. Key words included ankle arthroplasty, total ankle arthroplasty, ankle
      arthrodesis, and diabetes. Results: The total number of procedures was 26 287,
      comprising 13 830 arthroplasty and 12 457 arthrodesis procedures. There was a
      significant association between patients with diabetes treated with arthrodesis
      and major adverse events (odds ratio [OR] 1.880, 95% CI 1.279, 2.762), whereas no
      significant association was observed between patients with diabetes treated with 
      arthroplasty and major adverse events (OR 1.106, 95% CI 0.871, 1.404).
      Conclusion: This meta-analysis suggests patients with diabetes to be at
      significantly higher risk for major and minor adverse events after undergoing
      ankle arthrodesis. However, it suggests no significant differences in major
      adverse events between patients with diabetes and patients without diabetes
      having undergone total ankle arthroplasty. Level of Evidence: Level III,
      systematic review and meta-analysis.

TI  - Prevalence and Regulation of Dyslipidemia Among Adults With Type 2 Diabetes From 
      Three Primary Health Care Centers in Riyadh.
PG  - e27573
LID - 10.7759/cureus.27573 [doi]
AB  - Background Dyslipidemia is an added risk factor in patients with type 2 diabetes 
      who are more prone to develop cardiovascular diseases as it implies an alteration
      of the lipid level leading to serious health complications. Objective This study 
      aimed at assessing the prevalence of dyslipidemia among patients with type 2
      diabetes and comparing the lipid profile measurements between controlled and
      uncontrolled type 2 diabetic patients. Method A cross-sectional retrospective
      study was performed in three primary health care centers in Saudi Arabia. A
      sample of 418 patients with type 2 diabetes was enrolled in this study. To
      collect data, the researcher used a structured questionnaire and retrieved
      patients' data from the electronic medical records in the study setting. Results 
      The findings of the study showed that 82.1% of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM)
      patients recruited in this study were dyslipidemic. In addition, it was found
      that there was a significant difference in triglycerides, fasting blood sugar
      (FBS), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) between controlled and uncontrolled
      diabetic patients (p</=0.05). Moreover, a significant interaction was found
      between gender, HbA1c control, educational level, and frequency of exercising on 
      one hand and dyslipidemia on the other hand (p</=0.05). Conclusion The study
      concluded that there is a high prevalence of dyslipidemia among type 2 diabetic
      patients in Saudi Arabia and a significant interaction between dyslipidemia and
      diabetic patients' gender, HbA1c control, educational level, and frequency of
      exercising. The study recommends increasing type 2 diabetic patients' awareness
      regarding the management of diabetes and dyslipidemia and the importance of
      providing educational intervention regarding diabetes self-care activities.

AB  - Emerging evidence has shown that microRNAs (miRNAs) play critical role in the
      pathogenesis of several disorders. In the present minireview, we focus our
      attention on the functional role of a specific miRNA, namely miR-34a, in the
      pathophysiology of frailty and diabetes mellitus. Based on the current
      literature, we speculate that this miRNA may serve as a potential biomarker of
      frailty in diabetic older adults. Additionally, its actions on oxidative stress
      might represent a druggable target to obtain new potentials treatments.

TI  - Self-Care in Patients with Non-Optimal Diabetes Management in Brazilian Rural
      Areas: A Mixed-Methods Study.
PG  - 1831-1842
LID - 10.2147/PPA.S373302 [doi]
AB  - Purpose: This study aims to assess self-care in patients with non-optimal
      diabetes management (HbA1c >7.0% for adults and >8.0 for those aged 60 or over)
      and the positive and negative experiences associated with it in the rural
      communities of a Brazilian municipality. Patient and Methods: This is a
      cross-sectional mixed-methods study. The data were collected from participants
      with high HbA1c through focus group discussions, subsequently performing thematic
      analysis, and through structured questionnaires (socioeconomic characteristics
      and the Summary of Diabetes Self-Care Activities (SDSCA)). Results: The mean
      HbA1c of the 156 study participants was 9.94% (95% confidence interval:
      9.70-10.19%) and most participants (86.54%) had negative self-care behaviors,
      with an overall SDSCA mean score of 3.55. This mean was not positive for any of
      the socioeconomic characteristics. The self-care activities with the most
      satisfactory performance concerned non-smoking and the use of prescribed
      medications, and the poorest results were observed for the practice of specific
      physical activities. The qualitative data indicated that the study participants
      face many difficulties regarding self-care practices, especially those related to
      an adequate diet. Conclusion: The self-care assessment revealed unsatisfactory
      self-care behaviors as well as high HbA1c levels among the study participants and
      highlighted the various difficulties they encounter. This indicates the need for 
      more attentive health teams to monitor patients, especially regarding actions
      focused on the non-pharmacological elements of self-care, such as lifestyle
      changes, which were found to be the dimensions with the most unsatisfactory
      results.

TI  - Latent Autoimmune Diabetes in Adults: Background, Safety and Feasibility of an
      Ongoing Pilot Study With Intra-Lymphatic Injections of GAD-Alum and Oral Vitamin 
      D.

AB  - Background: Latent Autoimmune Diabetes in Adults (LADA) constitutes around 10% of
      all diabetes. Many LADA patients gradually lose their insulin secretion and
      progress to insulin dependency. In a recent trial BALAD (Behandling Av LADa)
      early insulin treatment compared with sitagliptin failed to preserve insulin
      secretion, which deteriorated in individuals displaying high levels of antibodies
      to GAD (GADA). These findings prompted us to evaluate a treatment that directly
      affects autoimmunity. Intra-lymphatic GAD-alum treatment has shown encouraging
      results in Type 1 diabetes patients. We therefore tested the feasibility of such 
      therapy in LADA-patients (the GADinLADA pilot study). Material and Methods:
      Fourteen GADA-positive (>190 RU/ml), insulin-independent patients 30-70 years
      old, with LADA diagnosed within < 36 months were included in an open-label
      feasibility trial. They received an intra-nodal injection of 4 mug GAD-alum at
      Day 1, 30 and 60 plus oral Vitamin D 2000 U/d from screening 30 days before (Day 
      -30) for 4 months if the vitamin D serum levels were below 100 nmol/L (40 ng/ml).
      Primary objective is to evaluate safety and feasibility. Mixed Meal Tolerance
      Test and i.v. Glucagon Stimulation Test at baseline and after 5 and 12 months are
      used for estimation of beta cell function. Results will be compared with those of
      the recent BALAD study with comparable patient population. Immunological response
      is followed. Results: Preliminary results show feasibility and safety, with
      almost stable beta cell function and metabolic control during follow-up so far (5
      months). Conclusions: Intra-lymphatic GAD-alum treatment is an option to preserve
      beta cell function in LADA-patients. An ongoing trial in 14 LADA-patients show
      feasibility and safety. Clinical and immunological responses will determine how
      to proceed with future trials.

TI  - The Association Between the Triglyceride-to-High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol 
      Ratio and the Risk of Progression to Diabetes From Prediabetes: A 5-year Cohort
      Study in Chinese Adults.
PG  - 947157
LID - 10.3389/fendo.2022.947157 [doi]
AB  - Objective: Evidence regarding the relationship between the
      triglyceride-to-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (TG/HDL-c) ratio and the
      risk of progression from prediabetes to diabetes remains limited. The purpose of 
      our study was to investigate the relationship between the TG/HDL-C ratio and
      incident diabetes in prediabetic patients. Methods: This retrospective cohort
      study covered 32 regions and 11 cities in China and consecutively and
      non-selectively collected data from 15,017 patients with prediabetes who had
      received a health check from 2010 to 2016. Data were obtained from the DATADRYAD 
      database (www.datadryad.org). The Cox proportional-hazards regression model with 
      cubic spline functions and smooth curve fitting (cubic spline smoothing) was used
      to explore the non-linear relationship between the baseline TG/HDL-c ratio and
      the risk of diabetes in patients with prediabetes. In addition, we performed a
      series of sensitivity and subgroup analyses. Results: The mean age of the
      included individuals was 50.95 +/- 13.48 years, and 9,745 (64.51%) were men. The 
      median (interquartile range) TG/HDL-c ratio was 1.09 (0.69-1.72). During a median
      follow-up time of 3.05 years, 1,731 (11.46%) patients had a final diagnosis of
      diabetes. The analysis after adjusting for covariates showed that the TG/HDL-c
      ratio was positively related to incident diabetes in patients with prediabetes
      (HR = 1.111, 95% CI 1.061-1.164). Participants with the highest TG/HDL-c ratio
      (Q4) had higher diabetes incidence rates than those with the lowest TG/HDL-c
      ratio (Q1) (P < 0.001 for the trend). There was a non-linear relationship between
      the TG/HDL-c ratio and the risk of diabetes, and the inflection point of the
      TG/HDL-c ratio was 1.415. The effect sizes (HR) on the left and right sides of
      the inflection point were 1.336 (95% CI: 1.134-1.573) and 1.055 (95% CI:
      0.988-1.126), respectively. The sensitivity analysis demonstrated the robustness 
      of these results. Conclusion: This study demonstrates a positive, non-linear
      relationship between the TG/HDL-c ratio and the risk of diabetes in Chinese
      patients with prediabetes. Aggressive intervention from a treatment perspective
      is required to lower the TG/HDL-c ratio below the inflection point (1.415) by
      lowering TG or increasing HDL-c levels.

LID - 10.2471/BLT.22.288045 [doi]
AB  - Objective: To implement a community-based screening and awareness-raising project
      for gestational diabetes in Ahmedabad, India. Methods: The project took place
      between April 2016 and August 2019 in Ahmedabad. Medical college faculty members 
      and medical officers trained 3582 paramedical staff on screening for gestational 
      diabetes. These paramedical staff tested all pregnant women 24-28 weeks
      gestation, who were attending village health and nutrition days - also called
      mamta days - in urban and rural health centres for routine antenatal care, for
      gestational diabetes. An oral glucose tolerance test was used and blood sugar >/=
      7.8 mmol/L was the cut-off for gestational diabetes. Women with gestational
      diabetes were referred for counselling and treatment and all women were followed 
      until 6 weeks after delivery. Findings: Of 53 522 pregnant women screened, 6786
      (12.7%) had gestational diabetes and were referred for nutritional therapy or
      medication; 836 (12.3%) of these women started medication. There was no
      significant difference in the prevalence of stillbirths between women with
      gestational diabetes (0.8%; 54/6786) and women without (0.7%; 338/46 736;
      P-value: 0.51). Of the women on treatment, 38 had abnormal blood glucose after
      delivery and continued with the medication. Two women with gestational diabetes
      died; they had other associated co-morbidities - pre-eclampsia and anaemia.
      Conclusion: We found a high prevalence of gestational diabetes, indicating the
      need for gestational diabetes screening and implementation of this project on a
      larger scale. Gestational diabetes screening at the community level is
      operationally feasible using the existing human resources and infrastructure of
      the reproductive health programmes.

TI  - Comparative analysis of the efficacies of probiotic supplementation and

      and meta-analysis.
PG  - 825897
LID - 10.3389/fnut.2022.825897 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the effects
      of probiotics and glucose-lowering drugs (thiazolidinedione [TZD], glucagon-like 
      pep-tide-1 receptor agonists [GLP-1 RA], dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitors, and 
      sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors [SGLT-2i]) in patients with type 2
      diabetes from randomized con-trolled trials (RCTs). The PubMed, Web of science,
      Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were searched on the treatment effects of 
      probiotics and glucose-lowering drugs on glycemia, lipids, and blood pressure
      metabolism published between Jan 2015 and April 2021. We performed meta-analyses 
      using the random-effects model. We included 25 RCTs (2,843 participants).
      Overall, GLP-1RA, SGLT-2i, and TZD significantly reduce fasting blood sugar (FBS)
      and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), whereas GLP-1 RA increased the risk of
      hypoglycaemia. Multispecies probiotics decrease FBS, total cholesterol (TC), and 
      systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP). Moreover, subgroup analyses
      indicated that participants aged >55 years, BMI >/=30 kg/m(2), longer duration of
      intervention, and subjects from Eastern countries, showed significantly higher
      reduction in FBS and HbA1c, TC, TG and SBP. This meta-analysis revealed that
      including multiple probiotic rather than glucose-lowering drugs might be more
      beneficial regarding T2D prevention who suffering from simultaneously
      hyperglycemia, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertension.

      insipidus (NDI) in children. Published reports on the treatment of nocturnal
      enuresis in this population are scarce. Presenting concern of the patient: 2
      brothers, aged 8 and 9 years, presented for outpatient pediatric nephrology
      follow-up. Despite being medically stable on their current medication regimen,
      they both experienced significant distress due to primary nocturnal enuresis,
      including decreased self-esteem and social stress. Diagnoses: The brothers had
      primary nocturnal enuresis related to their high urine output from NDI.
      Interventions: we describe a case of 2 brothers with NDI in whom indomethacin was
      added to their pharmacologic treatment specifically to address enuresis. Outcome:
      Both brothers experienced a significant decrease in the frequency of nocturnal
      enuresis and improvement in their perceived quality of life. Teaching points:
      Nocturnal enuresis is a bothersome symptom of NDI with adverse psychological
      effects. Indomethacin can improve nocturnal enuresis in some patients. Treatment 
      with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs carries a risk of gastrointestinal and 
      kidney side effects. We advocate for a patient-centered approach to the treatment
      of NDI which includes optimizing both the medical and the psychological needs of 
      the patient.

AB  - Introduction: The use of personalised care planning has been effective at
      improving health outcomes for people with long-term health conditions. Methods:
      We analysed data in relation to changes in BMI/HbA1c. The sample was made up of
      (n = 36) participants randomised to either the active intervention group
      (App+usual care) or the control group (usual care). Results: The average HbA1c
      percentage change for the treatment group was 9.5%, but just -2% for the control 
      (usual care) group (P = 0.015 for the difference). The average percentage change 
      in BMI for the treatment group was -0.4%, but 0.1% for the control group (P =
      0.03 for the difference). Conclusion: These preliminary findings point to how the
      provision of personalised plans of care, support and education linked to a mobile
      app, can result in HbA1c and BMI reduction over a 6-month period. While the
      results are preliminary, they portend the potential for digital plans of care to 
      enhance T2DM management.

TI  - Serum lipidomic determinants of human diabetic neuropathy in type 2 diabetes.
LID - 10.1002/acn3.51639 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The serum lipidomic profile associated with neuropathy in type 2
      diabetes is not well understood. Obesity and dyslipidemia are known neuropathy
      risk factors, suggesting lipid profiles early during type 2 diabetes may identify
      individuals who develop neuropathy later in the disease course. This
      retrospective cohort study examined lipidomic profiles 10 years prior to type 2
      diabetic neuropathy assessment. METHODS: Participants comprised members of the
      Gila River Indian community with type 2 diabetes (n = 69) with available stored
      serum samples and neuropathy assessment 10 years later using the combined
      Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument (MNSI) examination and questionnaire
      scores. A combined MNSI index was calculated from examination and questionnaire
      scores. Serum lipids (435 species from 18 classes) were quantified by mass
      spectrometry. RESULTS: The cohort included 17 males and 52 females with a mean
      age of 45 years (SD = 9 years). Participants were stratified as with (high MNSI
      index score > 2.5407) versus without neuropathy (low MNSI index score </=
      2.5407). Significantly decreased medium-chain acylcarnitines and increased total 
      free fatty acids, independent of chain length and saturation, in serum at
      baseline associated with incident peripheral neuropathy at follow-up, that is,
      participants had high MNSI index scores, independent of covariates. Participants 
      with neuropathy also had decreased phosphatidylcholines and increased
      lysophosphatidylcholines at baseline, independent of chain length and saturation.
      The abundance of other lipid classes did not differ significantly by neuropathy
      status. INTERPRETATION: Abundance differences in circulating acylcarnitines, free
      fatty acids, phosphatidylcholines, and lysophosphatidylcholines 10 years prior to
      neuropathy assessment are associated with neuropathy status in type 2 diabetes.

      intraneural facilitation: a single blind randomized control trial.
PG  - 3000605221109390
LID - 10.1177/03000605221109390 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of intraneural facilitation (INF) for
      the treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN). METHODS: This
      single-blind, randomized clinical trial enrolled patients with type 2 diabetes
      mellitus and moderate-to-severe DPN symptoms below the ankle. Patients were
      randomly assigned to receive INF or sham treatment. In the INF group, trained INF
      physical therapists provided therapy for 50-60 min, three times a week for 3
      weeks. Sham treatment consisted of patients believing they received anodyne
      therapy for 3 weeks. Pre- and post-treatment data were compared between the two
      groups for quality of life, balance, gait, protective sensory function and pain
      outcome measures. RESULTS: A total of 28 patients (17 males) were enrolled in the
      study (INF group n = 17; sham group n = 11). There was a significant decrease in 
      the overall pain score in both the INF and sham groups over time, but the
      decrease was greater in the INF group (1.11 versus 0.82). Between-group
      comparisons demonstrated significant differences in unpleasant pain and
      protective sensory function. The INF group showed post-treatment improvements in 
      protective sensory function and composite static balance score. CONCLUSIONS: INF 
      treatment improved pain perception, the composite static balance score and
      protective sensations in patients with DPN.Research Registry number:

TI  - Association Between Physical Activity, Sedentary Behavior and Physical Fitness
      and Glycated Hemoglobin in Youth with Type 1 Diabetes: A Systematic Review and
      Meta-analysis.
LID - 10.1007/s40279-022-01741-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Scientific literature suggests poor glycemic control in youth with
      type 1 diabetes (T1D) and physical inactivity, sedentary behavior and low
      physical fitness levels, although results are not entirely consistent. OBJECTIVE:
      To meta-analyze the association between glycated hemoglobin and physical
      activity, sedentary behavior, and physical fitness in children and adolescents
      with T1D. METHODS: Our meta-analysis was conducted following the Preferred
      Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Guidelines (PRISMA).
      Three databases were searched for studies. All studies meeting the following
      criteria were included: (1) Population: children and adolescents with a mean age 
      between 3 and 18 years diagnosed with T1D; (2) Exposition: physical activity
      and/or sedentary behavior and/or cardiorespiratory fitness and/or muscular
      fitness; (3) Outcome: glycated hemoglobin; (4) Study design: cross-sectional,
      longitudinal, and case-control studies. Pooled effects were calculated using a
      random effects inverse-variance model with the Hartung-Knapp-Sidik-Jonkman
      adjustment. RESULTS: Thirty-seven studies were included, accounting for a total
      of 34,863 youths with T1D (51.9% girls). Twenty-nine studies evaluated physical
      activity, eight sedentary behavior, 14 cardiorespiratory fitness, and two
      muscular fitness. A negative association between physical activity (r = - 0.09,
      95% CI - 0.14 to - 0.04; I(2) = 63.5%), cardiorespiratory fitness (r = - 0.31,
      95% CI - 0.44 to - 0.19; I(2) = 57.0%) and glycated hemoglobin was found. Also,
      the association with sedentary behavior was positive (r = 0.20, 95% CI 0.04 to
      0.35; I(2) = 92.6%). All the associations were independent of the glycated
      hemoglobin levels and diabetes duration. CONCLUSIONS: Low levels of physical
      activity and cardiorespiratory fitness and extensive sedentary behavior may
      explain part of the variance in glycated hemoglobin and part of the risk for poor
      glycemic control in youth with T1D. PROSPERO: Registration number:

TI  - Compensatory thalamocortical functional hyperconnectivity in type 2 Diabetes
      Mellitus.
LID - 10.1007/s11682-022-00710-0 [doi]
AB  - Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is associated with brain damage and cognitive
      decline. Despite the fact that the thalamus involves aspects of cognition and is 
      typically affected in T2DM, existing knowledge of subregion-level thalamic damage
      and its associations with cognitive performance in T2DM patients is limited. The 
      thalamus was subdivided into 8 subregions in each hemisphere. Resting-state
      functional and structural MRI data were collected to calculate resting-state
      functional connectivity (rsFC) and gray matter volume (GMV) of each thalamic
      subregion in 62 T2DM patients and 50 healthy controls. Compared with controls,
      T2DM patients showed increased rsFC of the medial pre-frontal thalamus, posterior
      parietal thalamus, and occipital thalamus with multiple cortical regions.
      Moreover, these thalamic functional hyperconnectivity were associated with better
      cognitive performance and lower glucose variability in T2DM patients. However,
      there were no group differences in GMV for any thalamic subregions. These
      findings suggest a possible neural compensation mechanism whereby selective
      thalamocortical functional hyperconnectivity facilitated by better glycemic
      control help to preserve cognitive ability in T2DM patients, which may ultimately
      inform intervention and prevention of T2DM-related cognitive decline in
      real-world clinical settings.

TI  - Plasma prostasin: a novel risk marker for incidence of diabetes and cancer
      mortality.
LID - 10.1007/s00125-022-05771-w [doi]
AB  - AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Diabetes is associated with an increased risk of cancer.
      Prostasin is an epithelial sodium channel stimulator that has been associated
      with suppression of tumours, glucose metabolism and hyperglycaemia-associated
      tumour pathology. However, the association between prostasin, diabetes and cancer
      mortality has not been well investigated in humans. We aim to investigate the
      associations between plasma prostasin and diabetes, and to explore whether
      prostasin has an effect on cancer mortality risk in individuals with
      hyperglycaemia. METHODS: Plasma prostasin was measured using samples from the
      Malmo Diet and Cancer Study Cardiovascular Cohort, and statistical analysis was
      performed from both sex-specific quartiles and per 1 SD. The cross-sectional
      association between plasma prostasin and diabetes was first studied in 4658
      participants (age 57.5 +/- 5.9 years, 39.9% men). After excluding 361 with
      prevalent diabetes, the associations of prostasin with incident diabetes and
      cancer mortality risk were assessed using Cox regression analysis. The
      interactions between prostasin and blood glucose levels as well as other
      covariates were tested. RESULTS: The adjusted OR for prevalent diabetes in the
      4th vs 1st quartile of prostasin concentrations was 1.95 (95% CI 1.39, 2.76) (p
      for trend <0.0001). During mean follow-up periods of 21.9 +/- 7.0 and 23.5 +/-
      6.1 years, respectively, 702 participants developed diabetes and 651 died from
      cancer. Prostasin was significantly associated with the incidence of diabetes.
      The adjusted HR for diabetes in the 4th vs 1st quartile of prostasin
      concentrations was 1.76 (95% CI 1.41, 2.19) (p for trend <0.0001). Prostasin was 
      also associated with cancer mortality There was a significant interaction between
      prostasin and fasting blood glucose for cancer mortality risk (p for interaction 
      =0.022), with a stronger association observed in individuals with impaired
      fasting blood glucose levels at baseline (HR per 1 SD change 1.52; 95% CI 1.07,
      2.16; p=0.019). CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Plasma prostasin levels are
      positively associated with diabetes risk and with cancer mortality risk,
      especially in individuals with high blood glucose levels, which may shed new
      light on the relationship between diabetes and cancer.

TI  - Effect of Concomitant Drug Use on the Onset and Exacerbation of Diabetes Mellitus
      in Everolimus-Treated Cancer.
PG  - 245-252
LID - 10.18433/jpps32908 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Everolimus-induced diabetes mellitus (DM) outcomes include
      everolimus-resistant tumors and poor hyperglycemia outcomes, which lead to
      various other negative clinical outcomes. This study aimed to evaluate the effect
      of associations between concomitant drug treatment and time to DM event
      occurrence (onset or exacerbation) on the outcomes of everolimus-induced DM in
      patients with cancer. METHODS: Data from the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report
      database (JADER) were used, and patient drug use, time of DM event occurrence,
      and DM outcomes were determined from patient records. Associations between
      concomitant drug groups with everolimus and DM event occurrence were then
      evaluated for patients with both good and poor DM outcomes. RESULTS: Top ten
      groups used concomitantly were drugs for the treatment of hypertension (HT),
      controlled DM, constipation, hypothyroidism, kidney disease, insomnia,
      hyperlipidemia, hyperuricemia, anemia, and gastritis. Among them, only HT,
      controlled DM, and hyperlipidemia were associated with DM event occurrence. These
      three drug groups were examined by the outcome of everolimus concomitant usage
      and revealed a significantly shorter time to DM event occurrence for patients
      with poor outcomes than for those with good outcomes (p = 0.015) among patients
      without a concomitant drug for DM. Each of these three drug groups was analyzed
      on patients who were concomitantly administered with one of each drug group with 
      everolimus and revealed a significantly shorter time to DM event occurrence for
      patients with poor outcomes than for those with good outcomes in patients who
      received concomitant HT drugs (p = 0.006). Moreover, among the four HT drug
      categories, calcium channel blockers were significantly associated with poor
      outcomes (odds ratio, 2.18 [1.09-4.34], p = 0.028). CONCLUSION: To prevent
      everolimus-induced poor DM outcomes, early DM detection and treatment are
      necessary, and the effect of the concomitant drug should be considered before
      initiating everolimus treatment.

TI  - Control of Diabetes Mellitus and Long-Term Prognosis in Stroke Patients: The
      Shiga Stroke and Heart Attack Registry.
PG  - 1-8
LID - 10.1159/000525648 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The relationship between diabetes control status and long-term
      prognosis after stroke incidence remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate
      the effect of diabetes status at admission on long-term survival in patients with
      first-ever stroke. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted based on
      the Shiga Stroke and Heart Attack Registry in Japan. Patients were classified
      according to their diabetes status and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) value at
      hospital admission into the following: (1) free of diabetes (no history of
      diabetes and HbA1c <6.5%); (2) good control (history of diabetes and HbA1c <7%;
      free of history and 6.5% </=HbA1c <7%); and (3) poor control (with or without a
      history of diabetes and HbA1c >/=7%). Multivariable Cox regression models were
      used to evaluate the association between diabetes status and long-term survival
      from stroke onset. Additionally, we also evaluated the association between
      diabetes status and conditional survival, beginning 29 days after stroke onset.
      RESULTS: A total of 6,331 first-ever stroke patients were eligible for this
      study. Among study patients, the mean (+/-SD) age was 72.85 +/- 13.19 years, and 
      the mean (+/-SD) follow-up year was 2.76 +/- 1.66 years; additionally, 42.09% of 
      patients were women. Among patients with all strokes, considering the
      free-of-diabetes group as the reference group, the adjusted hazard ratio (95%
      confidence interval) for mortality was 1.26 (1.10, 1.44) in the good control
      group and 1.22 (1.05, 1.41) in the poor control group. Among patients with
      ischemic stroke, the adjusted hazard ratio was 1.24 (1.06, 1.46) in good control 
      group and 1.27 (1.08, 1.50) in poor control group. After excluding patients who
      died within 28 days, the adjusted hazard ratio for conditional mortality in the
      poor control group was 1.31 (1.12, 1.54) among all stroke patients and 1.29
      (1.08, 1.54) among ischemic stroke patients. No significant associations were
      observed between diabetic status and long-term mortality in intracerebral
      hemorrhage patients. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that first-ever stroke
      patients with diabetes exhibited a higher risk of all-cause mortality than those 
      without diabetes, particularly in the overall stroke and ischemic stroke
      populations. Additionally, in stroke populations after 28 days of onset, high
      risk of long-term mortality was stated in stroke patients with poor HbA1c
      control.

TI  - Appropriate neck/waist circumference cut-off points for gestational diabetes
      prediction in Iranian pregnant women: The baseline analysis of the Qazvin
      maternal and neonatal metabolic study (QMNMS), Iran.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Gestational diabetes is the most common complication during pregnancy
      and it is essential to identify the high-risk groups for gestational diabetes
      mellitus (GDM) in the first trimester. A large neck circumference (NC) in the
      first trimester is a measure of obesity. OBJECTIVE: The present study
      investigated whether pregnant women's first-trimester NC and waist circumference 
      (WC) measurements present a predictive index for GDM diagnosis. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: This longitudinal cohort study was conducted on 676 pregnant women aged 
      >/=20 years. Pregnant women at 12-14th (baseline) gestational weeks underwent
      measurement of neck and other anthropometric indices. GDM was diagnosed with 75-g
      oral glucose tolerance test at 24-28th gestational week. RESULTS: GDM was
      developed in 110 (16.3%) pregnant women. The logistic regression analysis showed 
      that baseline NC > 33.5 cm (OR: 2.037, 95% CI: 1.313-3.161; P = 0.002) and WC >
      90.5 (OR: 2.299, 95% CI: 1.510-3.501; p < 0.001) were independent predictors of
      GDM. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis of
      baseline NC and WC for GDM prediction respectively yielded 0.614 (95% CI:
      0.558-0.670, p < 0.001) and 0.641 (CI: 0.583-0.698, p < 0.001). The optimal
      cut-off level of maternal baseline NC was >33.5 cm, with 68.5% sensitivity and
      48.3% specificity, and for baseline WC it was >90.5.50 cm, with 57% sensitivity
      and 63.4% specificity. CONCLUSION: Pregnant women with an NC > 33.5 cm and a WC >
      90.5 cm at baseline (12-14th gestational weeks) had a higher chance of developing
      GDM. first-trimester NC and waist circumference (WC) measurements present a
      predictive index for GDM diagnosis.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The diabetes eating problem survey-revised (DEPS-R)
      questionnaire is a specific and valuable tool for assessing disturbed eating
      behavior in type 1 diabetes mellitus. The literature suggests an association
      between a higher DEPS-R score and worse metabolic control; however, these figures
      have not been described in patients from Latin America. METHODS: We evaluated 58 
      patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus from a Brazilian outpatient clinic using
      the DEPS-R questionnaire. RESULTS: Overall, 23 participants with a high risk for 
      high eating disorder behaviors exhibited significantly increased hemoglobin A1c
      levels compared with 35 patients with a DEPS-R score <20. CONCLUSIONS: Our data
      support that the presence of a DEPS-R score >20 negatively affects the metabolic 
      control of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus in Brazil.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Our aim was to summarize, analyze and disseminate the
      current state of knowledge about the barriers and facilitators in postpartum
      reclassification that women who have had gestational diabetes face. METHODS: Data
      collection was carried out from January to March 2021 in PubMed, Scopus, Web of
      Science (WoS), Embase and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health
      Literature (CINAHL) databases. RESULTS: Of the 361 studies initially retrieved in
      the search, 32 articles published between 2010 and 2020 were selected because
      they were within our objective. CONCLUSION: Multiple barriers and interventions
      were found regarding the reclassification of the glycemic status of women who had
      Gestational Diabetes during pregnancy. Therefore, further studies are needed to
      achieve a better intervention for this condition.

TI  - Exocrine pancreas regeneration modifies original pancreas to alleviate diabetes
      in mouse models.
PG  - eabg9170
LID - 10.1126/scitranslmed.abg9170 [doi]
AB  - Diabetes is a major public health issue because of its widely epidemic nature and
      lack of cure. Here, we show that pancreas-derived mesenchymal stem cells (PMSCs) 
      are capable of regenerating exocrine pancreas when implanted into the kidney
      capsule of mice with streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes. Mechanistically, we
      found that the regenerated exocrine pancreas elevated interleukin-6 (IL-6) in
      PMSC implants, which transiently activated tumor necrosis factor-alpha
      (TNF-alpha) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) to inhibit IL-17, thereby rescuing
      damaged exocrine pancreas and islet beta cells. In addition, we used knockout
      mouse models to show that global lack of IL-6, TNF-alpha, or IFN-gamma resulted
      in increased severity of STZ-induced diabetes and resistance to PMSC implantation
      therapy, confirming the roles of these factors in safeguarding pancreatic beta
      cells. Furthermore, removal of the kidney capsule PMSC implants at 28 days after 
      implantation did not affect the PMSC-initiated therapeutic effect on diabetic
      mice. This study reveals a previously unknown role of exocrine pancreas
      regeneration in safeguarding beta cells and demonstrates a "soil-rescues-seed"
      strategy for type 1 diabetes therapy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The association between insulin resistance and cancer-mortality is
      not fully explored. We investigated the association between several insulin
      sensitivity indices (ISIs) and cancer-mortality over 3.5 decades in a cohort of
      adult men and women. We hypothesized that higher insulin resistance will be
      associated with greater cancer-mortality risk. METHODS: A cohort of 1,612 men and
      women free of diabetes during baseline were followed since 1979 through 2016
      according to level of insulin resistance (IR) for cause specific mortality, as
      part of the Israel study on Glucose Intolerance, Obesity and Hypertension (GOH). 
      IR was defined according to the Mcauley index (MCAi), calculated by fasting
      insulin and triglycerides, the Homeostatic Model Assessment (HOMA), the Matsuda
      Insulin Sensitivity Index (MISI), and the Quantitative Insulin Sensitivity Check 
      Index (QUICKI), calculated by plasma glucose and insulin. RESULTS: Mean age at
      baseline was 51.5 +/- 8.0 years, 804 (49.9%) were males and 871 (54.0%) had
      prediabetes. Mean follow-up was 36.7+/-0.2 years and 47,191 person years were
      accrued. Cox proportional hazard model and competing risks analysis adjusted for 
      age, sex, country of origin, BMI, blood pressure, total cholesterol, smoking and 
      glycemic status, revealed an increased risk for cancer-mortality, HR = 1.5 (95%
      CI: 1.1-2.0, p = 0.005) for the MCAi Q1 compared with Q2-4. No statistically
      significant associations were observed between the other ISIs and
      cancer-mortality. CONCLUSION: The MCAi was independently associated with an
      increased risk for cancer-mortality in adult men and women free of diabetes and
      should be further studied as an early biomarker for cancer risk.

TI  - Type 2 diabetes disrupts circadian orchestration of lipid metabolism and membrane
      fluidity in human pancreatic islets.
PG  - e3001725
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.3001725 [doi]
AB  - Recent evidence suggests that circadian clocks ensure temporal orchestration of
      lipid homeostasis and play a role in pathophysiology of metabolic diseases in
      humans, including type 2 diabetes (T2D). Nevertheless, circadian regulation of
      lipid metabolism in human pancreatic islets has not been explored. Employing
      lipidomic analyses, we conducted temporal profiling in human pancreatic islets
      derived from 10 nondiabetic (ND) and 6 T2D donors. Among 329 detected lipid
      species across 8 major lipid classes, 5% exhibited circadian rhythmicity in ND
      human islets synchronized in vitro. Two-time point-based lipidomic analyses in
      T2D human islets revealed global and temporal alterations in phospho- and
      sphingolipids. Key enzymes regulating turnover of sphingolipids were rhythmically
      expressed in ND islets and exhibited altered levels in ND islets bearing
      disrupted clocks and in T2D islets. Strikingly, cellular membrane fluidity,
      measured by a Nile Red derivative NR12S, was reduced in plasma membrane of T2D
      diabetic human islets, in ND donors' islets with disrupted circadian clockwork,
      or treated with sphingolipid pathway modulators. Moreover, inhibiting the
      glycosphingolipid biosynthesis led to strong reduction of insulin secretion
      triggered by glucose or KCl, whereas inhibiting earlier steps of de novo ceramide
      synthesis resulted in milder inhibitory effect on insulin secretion by ND islets.
      Our data suggest that circadian clocks operative in human pancreatic islets are
      required for temporal orchestration of lipid homeostasis, and that perturbation
      of temporal regulation of the islet lipid metabolism upon T2D leads to altered
      insulin secretion and membrane fluidity. These phenotypes were recapitulated in
      ND islets bearing disrupted clocks.

TI  - Early-onset diabetes involving three consecutive generations had different
      clinical features from age-matched type 2 diabetes without a family history in
      China.
LID - 10.1007/s12020-022-03144-2 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Early-onset, multigenerational diabetes is a heterogeneous disease,
      which is often simplistically classified as type 1 diabetes (T1D) or type 2
      diabetes(T2D). However, its clinical and genetic characteristics have not been
      clearly elucidated. The aim of our study is to investigate the clinical features 
      of early-onset diabetes involving three consecutive generations (eDia3) in a
      Chinese diabetes cohort. METHODS: Of 6470 type 2 diabetic patients, 105 were
      identified as eDia3 (1.6%). After a case-control match on age, we compared the
      clinical characteristics of 89 eDia3 patients with 89 early-onset T2D patients
      without a family history of diabetes (eDia0). WES was carried out in 89 patients 
      with eDia3. We primarily focused on 14 known maturity-onset diabetes of the young
      (MODY) genes. Variants were predicted by ten tools (SIFT, PolyPhen2_HDIV,
      PolyPhen2_HVAR, LRT, Mutation Assessor, Mutation Taster, FATHMM, GERP++, PhyloP, 
      and PhastCons). All suspected variants were then validated by Sanger sequencing
      and further investigated in the proband families. RESULTS: Compared to
      age-matched eDia0, eDia3 patients had a younger age at diagnosis (26.5 +/- 5.8
      vs. 29.4 +/- 5.3 years, P = 0.001), lower body mass index (25.5 +/- 3.9 vs. 27.4 
      +/- 4.6 kg/m(2), P = 0.003), lower systolic blood pressure (120 +/- 15 vs. 128
      +/- 18 mmHg, P = 0.003), and better metabolic profiles (including glucose and
      lipids). Of the 89 eDia3 patients, 10 (11.2%) carried likely pathogenic variants 
      in genes (KLF11, GCK, ABCC8, PAX4, BLK and HNF1A) of MODY. CONCLUSIONS: eDia3
      patients had unique clinical features. Known MODY genes were not common causes in
      these patients.

TI  - Assessment of a Decision Support System for Adults with Type 1 Diabetes on
      Multiple Daily Insulin Injections.
LID - 10.1089/dia.2022.0252 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: DailyDose is a decision support system designed to provide real
      time dosing advice and weekly insulin dose adjustments for adults living with
      type 1 diabetes using multiple daily insulin injections. MATERIALS AND METHODS:
      Twenty-five adults were enrolled in this single-arm study. All participants used 
      Dexcom G6 for continuous glucose monitoring, InPen for short-acting insulin
      doses, and Clipsulin to track long-acting insulin doses. Participants used
      DailyDose on an iPhone for 8 weeks. The primary endpoint was % time in range
      (TIR) comparing the 2-week baseline to the final 2-week period of DailyDose use. 
      RESULTS: There were no significant differences between TIR or other glycemic
      metrics between the baseline period compared to final 2-week period of DailyDose 
      use. TIR significantly improved by 6.3% when more than half of recommendations
      were accepted and followed as compared with 50% or less of recommendations (95%
      C.I. 2.5-10.1%, P=.001). CONCLUSIONS: Use of DailyDose did not improve glycemic
      outcomes as compared to the baseline period. In a post hoc analysis, accepting
      and following recommendations from DailyDose was associated with improved TIR.

TI  - Feasibility of Using a Factory-Calibrated CGM System to Diagnose Type 2 Diabetes.
LID - 10.1089/dia.2022.0189 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Plasma glucose or A1C criteria can be used to establish the diagnosis of
      type 2 diabetes (T2D). OBJECTIVE: We examined whether continuous glucose
      monitoring (CGM) data from a single 10-day wear period could form the basis of an
      alternative diagnostic test for T2D. Design. We developed a binary classification
      diagnostic CGM ("dCGM") algorithm using a dataset of 716 individual CGM sensor
      sessions (563 participants) with associated A1C measurements from seven clinical 
      trials. Data from 470 participants were used for training and 93 participants for
      testing (49 normoglycemic [A1C <5.7%], 27 prediabetes, and 17 T2D [A1C >/=6.5%]
      not using pharmacotherapy). dCGM performance was evaluated against the
      accompanying A1C measurement which was assumed to provide the correct diagnosis. 
      RESULTS: The dCGM algorithm's overall sensitivity, specificity, positive
      predictive value, and negative predictive value were 71%, 93%, 71%, and 93%,
      respectively. At other clinically relevant A1C thresholds, dCGM specificity among
      normoglycemic participants was 98% (48/49 correctly classified), and for
      participants with suboptimally-controlled diabetes (A1C >/=7%, above the ADA
      recommended A1C goal) the sensitivity was 100% (8/8 participants correctly
      diagnosed with T2D). CONCLUSIONS: Classifications based on the dCGM algorithm
      were in good agreement with traditional methods based on A1C. The dCGM algorithm 
      may provide an alternative method for screening and diagnosing T2D, and warrants 
      further investigation.

TI  - The activin receptor ligand trap ActRIIB:ALK4-Fc ameliorates cardiomyopathy
      induced by neuromuscular disease and diabetes.
LID - 10.1002/1873-3468.14464 [doi]
AB  - Cardiomyopathies are ascribed to a variety of etiologies, are present with
      diverse clinical phenotypes, and lack disease-modifying treatments. Mounting
      evidence implicates dysregulated activin receptor signaling in heart disease and 
      highlights inhibition of this pathway as a potential therapeutic target. Here, we
      explored the effects of activin ligand inhibition using ActRIIB:ALK4-Fc, a
      heterodimeric receptor fusion protein, in two mechanistically distinct murine
      models of cardiomyopathy. Treatment with ActRIIB:ALK4-Fc significantly improved
      systolic or diastolic function in cardiomyopathy induced by neuromuscular disease
      or diabetes mellitus. Moreover, ActRIIB:ALK4-Fc corrected Ca(2+) handling protein
      expression in diseased heart tissues, suggesting that activin signaling
      inhibition could alleviate cardiomyopathies in part by rebalancing aberrant
      intracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis-a common underlying pathomechanism in diverse
      heart diseases.

TI  - Association of cognition with leptin and vascular endothelial growth factor in
      individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
LID - 10.1002/oby.23495 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The 10-year intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) of the Look AHEAD
      study left a legacy of relative deficits in cognitive function among participants
      who entered the clinical trial with obesity or a history of cardiovascular
      disease. We hypothesized that altered levels of two weight-sensitive
      proangiogenic cytokines, leptin and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF),
      accounted for this concerning finding. METHODS: Serum leptin and VEGF
      concentrations were determined in 1,279 Look AHEAD participants at baseline,
      proximal to cessation of the interventions (Epoch 1), and an average of 4 years
      later (Epoch 2). Up to four standardized assessments of attention, executive
      function, and memory were collected during follow-up. Mixed effects models were
      used to assess relative differences in leptin and VEGF concentrations between
      intervention groups and whether these accounted for changes in cognitive
      composite scores. RESULTS: ILI and diabetes support and education differences in 
      VEGF, but not leptin, concentrations varied depending on baseline history of
      cardiovascular disease and obesity, but neither leptin nor VEGF concentrations
      accounted for the relative decrements in cognitive function in participants
      assigned to ILI. CONCLUSIONS: Alterations in two weight-sensitive proangiogenic
      cytokines did not account for the long-term adverse effects of ILI on cognitive
      function among adults with diabetes and either obesity or cardiovascular disease.

TI  - Evaluation of the Impact of Glycemic Control on Mean Platelet Volume and Platelet
      Activation in Children with Type 1 Diabetes.
LID - fmac063 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/tropej/fmac063 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The studies evaluating cases with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and 
      type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in the adult population reported hyperreactive
      platelets and increased activation of prothrombotic factors, resulting in an
      increased risk of thrombosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects
      of poor glycemic control and the duration of diabetes on platelet parameters in
      pediatric population. METHODS: The study included 366 children, out of which 144 
      (39.3%) were included in the T1DM group and 222 (60.6%) in the healthy control
      group. The platelet count, mean platelet volume (MPV), platelet distribution
      width and plateletcrit values were recorded. The children with T1DM were divided 
      into three groups as per their glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels, good (<7.5%), 
      moderate (7.5-9%) and poor metabolic control (>9%). RESULTS: No significant
      difference in the MPV level between the T1DM (7.41 +/- 1.49 fl) and control (7.15
      +/- 1.23 fl) groups was observed. However, the MPV levels were significantly
      higher in the poor glycemic control group than in the healthy control group (p = 
      0.026). Furthermore, as the duration of diabetes and HbA1c levels increased, the 
      MPV levels also increased (p < 0.001, p = 0.441). CONCLUSION: This study
      suggested as the duration of diabetes and HbA1c levels increased, the MPV levels 
      also increases. Evaluation of hematological parameters can be a cheap and useful 
      method in the evaluation of diabetes regulation in patients with diabetes.

TI  - Impact of gamification on glycaemic control among patients with type 2 diabetes
      mellitus: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.
PG  - oeab030
LID - 10.1093/ehjopen/oeab030 [doi]
AB  - Aims : The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is very high and still
      rising. Optimal medical therapy and lifestyle management are essential in
      reducing the long-term complications of T2DM. Gamification, which is the use of
      design elements, and characteristics of games in a non-gaming context, is an
      innovative approach to improve healthy behaviour. It thereby could be able to
      improve glycaemic control in T2DM. The aim of this systematic review and
      meta-analysis is to evaluate the effect of gamification on glycaemic control
      expressed by haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels in T2DM patients. Methods and results
      : All articles from 2000 to 2021 were searched in electronic databases (PubMed,
      Cochrane Library, Embase). The total number of patients was 704. The rate of male
      participants and their mean ages ranged, respectively, from 46% to 94% and 60 to 
      63 years. Inclusion criteria were randomized controlled trials of T2DM management
      using gamification which included HbA1c as an outcome measure. A meta-analysis
      was performed. After removing duplicates, 129 articles were screened and a total 
      of 3 articles corresponding to the inclusion criteria were identified.
      Haemoglobin A1c was significantly reduced [mean difference -0.21; 95% confidence 
      interval (-0.37 to -0.05); P = 0.01; I (2) = 0%] in the intervention group using 
      gamification as compared to the control group. Conclusion : Gamification has a
      positive effect on glycaemic control expressed by HbA1c changes in patients with 
      T2DM. However, only three studies were included in this review. More research is 
      needed to confirm the effectiveness of gamification in T2DM.

TI  - Absolute and relative risk prediction in cardiovascular primary prevention with a
      modified SCORE chart incorporating ceramide-phospholipid risk score and diabetes 
      mellitus.
PG  - oeab010
LID - 10.1093/ehjopen/oeab010 [doi]
AB  - Aims: A risk score, CERT2, based on distinct ceramide and phosphatidylcholine
      lipid species, has shown robust performance in predicting cardiovascular risk in 
      secondary prevention. Here, our aim was to investigate the predictive value of
      CERT2 in primary prevention compared to classical lipid biomarkers and its
      compatibility with clinical characteristics used in the SCORE risk chart. Methods
      and results: Four ceramides [Cer(d18:1/16:0), Cer(d18:1/18:0), Cer(d18:1/24:0),
      Cer(d18:1/24:1)] and three phosphatidylcholines [PC(14:0/22:6), PC(16:0/22:5),
      PC(16:0/16:0)] were analysed by targeted tandem liquid chromatography-mass
      spectrometry method in FINRISK 2002, which is a population-based risk factor
      survey investigating men and women aged 25-74 years. Primary prevention subjects 
      (N = 7324) were followed up for 10 years for the following outcomes: incident
      coronary heart disease (CHD), cardiovascular disease (CVD), major adverse
      cardiovascular event (MACE), stroke, and heart failure. Hazard ratios per
      standard deviation obtained from adjusted Cox proportional hazard models were
      significant for all these endpoints, and the highest for fatal ones, i.e. fatal
      CHD [1.45 (95% confidence interval 1.07-1.97)], CVD [1.39 (1.06-1.83)], and MACE 
      [1.39 (1.07-1.80)]. The categorical net reclassification improvement was 0.051
      for the 10-year risk of incident CVD. Incidence of fatal events was over 10-fold 
      more frequent in the highest CERT2 category compared to the lowest risk category 
      and modified SCORE risk charts, utilizing CERT2 and diabetes mellitus, increased 
      granularity of risk assessment compared to a chart utilizing total cholesterol.
      Conclusion: CERT2 is a significant predictor of incident cardiovascular outcomes 
      and risk charts utilizing this score provide an easy tool to estimate relative
      and absolute risk for incident CVD.

      Evidence from several large clinical trials.
PG  - 1118-1121
LID - 10.7150/ijms.72772 [doi]
AB  - Heart failure coexists with type 2 diabetes mellitus, which seriously affects the
      clinical treatment and prognosis. At present, the treatment for patients with
      established heart failure and type 2 diabetes mellitus is usually combined with
      two treatment strategies for heart failure and type 2 diabetes mellitus.
      Recently, increasing studies showed that empagliflozin, a sodium-glucose
      co-transporter-2 inhibitor, has a positive effect on the treatment of patients
      with established heart failure and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Here, we summarize
      the latest and current understanding of the management for patients with
      established heart failure and type 2 diabetes mellitus and further present
      contemporary treatment options, sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor, for
      these particular populations.

TI  - What do persons with diabetes want from community pharmacies? A qualitative
      study.
PG  - 2677
LID - 10.18549/PharmPract.2022.2.2677 [doi]
AB  - Background: Diabetes is a demanding disease with a complex treatment regimen.
      Many persons with diabetes have difficulty managing their disease and taking
      medication as prescribed, possibly because they lack knowledge and sometimes
      misinterpret medical benefits. Community pharmacies continuously provide
      professional counselling to persons with diabetes. Objective: This study aimed to
      explore 1) which services adults with type 1 and type 2 diabetes want from
      community pharmacies and 2) how pharmacies can meet these wishes. Methods: A
      qualitative, explorative study design using focus group interviews was chosen.
      Informants were recruited from Region Zealand in Denmark. Data were digitally
      recorded, transcribed verbatim and analyzed by means of thematic analysis.
      Results: Thirteen adults (11 female) with the mean age of 66.2 years (range 49-81
      years) participated in one physical (n=6) or one online (n=7) focus group
      interview. Ten had type 2 diabetes, three had type 1 diabetes. The average
      duration of participants' diabetes was 13.4 years (range 2.3-33.0 years). The
      analysis revealed three overall themes of the functions which the informants
      would like community pharmacies to fulfil: 1) raise awareness of pharmacies'
      counselling service and competences; 2) act as a dialogue partner; 3) be a source
      of information and guidance about local activities and support. Conclusion: The
      informants did not regard community pharmacies as a natural part of the
      healthcare system or as a place where they would expect counselling. They would
      like the community pharmacy to make their medical competences and services
      obvious and the community pharmacy staff to act as a dialogue partner and provide
      competent counselling. The informants would like to have a contact person with
      diabetes competences with whom they can book an appointment to complement
      over-the-counter counselling. They experience a gap in their care between routine
      visits in the healthcare system and suggest that community pharmacies counselling
      services become a natural supplement and that healthcare professionals in the
      primary and secondary sectors inform patients about the services - especially for
      patients newly diagnosed with diabetes. Finally, they would like a formal
      collaboration between diabetes associations and community pharmacies to make
      their competences, services and information visible.

TI  - A pilot study of Pharmacist-Dietician Collaborative support and Advice (PDCA) for
      patients with type 2 diabetes in community pharmacy: A single-arm, pre-post
      study.
PG  - 2657
LID - 10.18549/PharmPract.2022.2.2657 [doi]
AB  - Background: In Japan, there is a pressing need to improve community health care
      to cope with the rapid aging of the population. In this context, there have been 
      private-sector-led approaches to enhance community dietary support by employing
      dietitians in pharmacies. Objectives: To evaluate the effects of collaboration
      between dietitians and pharmacists working in pharmacies to support patients with
      type 2 diabetes. Methods: A single group pre- and post-comparative study was
      conducted on patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The intervention period was 
      6 months. During the intervention period, the dietitians provided dietary support
      to the patients after first providing them with medication guidance. The contents
      of these instructions were shared with the pharmacists. The contents of the
      instructions were recorded, and confirmed in monthly meetings with the principal 
      investigator. The primary endpoint was the Hemoglobin A1c(HbA1c) level, and the
      secondary endpoints were high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-c),
      low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-c), Triglyceride (TG), degree of dietary
      self-management, degree of unbalanced diet and satisfaction with pharmacy
      services. Results: Eight patients completed the intervention period. The first
      patient's intervention started in March 2021, and all patients' interventions
      were completed by December 2021. The primary endpoint, the mean (SD) HbA1c, was
      7.26 (0.96) at baseline and decreased to 6.63 (0.79) after 6 months (p=0.028,
      r=0.72). Also, the HDL-c increased from 55.00 (14.81) to 63.14 (10.11) (p=0.110, 
      r=0.51) and the Diabetes Mellitus Dietary Self Efficacy Scale score increased
      from 51.67 (8.31) to 60.17 (8.45) (p=0.025, r=0.79) and the patient satisfaction 
      score increased 24.0 (4.0) to 26.1 (3.3) (p=0.161, r=0.51). Moderate decreases
      were also observed in LDL-c (p=0.235, r=0.47) and TG (p=0.368, r=0.37).
      Conclusions: Collaboration between dietitians and pharmacists working in
      pharmacies may improve the dietary habits and glycemic control of patients with
      type 2 diabetes. To verify this hypothesis more reliably, randomized controlled
      trials need to be conducted.

TI  - Depression and quality of life in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 335-342
LID - 10.22088/cjim.13.2.3 [doi]
AB  - Background: Depression as a frequent comorbidity in patients with diabetes
      requires serious attention, as failure to early detect and treat it can adversely
      affect the patients' complications. This study was performed to assess the
      prevalence of depression and quality of life in these patients. Methods: This
      cross-sectional study was carried-out on adult patients with type 2 diabetes
      mellitus referred to the endocrinology hospital clinics affiliated to Babol
      University of Medical Sciences, Babol, Iran, during 2018-2019. The presence and
      severity of depressive symptoms in patients have been assessed by Beck Depression
      Inventory-II; and the quality of life was measured by SF-36 questionnaire.
      Results: Totally, 400 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (300 females and 100
      males) with mean age of 55.36+/-11.56 years were recruited. One hundred and
      thirty (32.5%) had depressive symptoms. Of the patients with depression, 115
      (28.8%) had mild and 15 (3.8%) had moderate depression. After entering different 
      variables in logistic regression analysis, gender (P=0.036) and ophthalmic
      complications (P=0.011) showed a significant association with depressive
      symptoms. The patients with depression had a worse quality of life compared to
      those who had not depressive symptoms. Quality of life score in patients with
      depression was significantly lower than patients without depression (p<0.0001).
      Conclusion: Nearly one third of the patients with type II diabetes mellitus might
      have depression. Diabetic patients with depression have a worse quality of life
      compared to those who have not depression symptoms.

TI  - Accuracy of obesity indices alone or in combination for prediction of diabetes: A
      novel risk score by linear combination of general and abdominal measures of
      obesity.
PG  - 326-334
LID - 10.22088/cjim.13.2.2 [doi]
AB  - Background: The predictive power of obesity measures varies according to the
      presence of coexistent measures. The present study aimed to determine the
      predictive power of combinations of obesity measures for diabetes by calculation 
      of a linear risk score. Methods: Data from a population-based cross-sectional
      study of 994 representative samples of Iranian adults in Babol, Iran were
      analyzed. Measures of obesity including waist circumference (WC), body mass index
      (BMI), waist-to-height ratio (WHtR), and waist to hip ratio (WHR) were
      calculated, and diabetes was diagnosed by fasting blood sugar >126 mg/dl or
      taking antidiabetic medication. Multiple logistic regression model was used to
      develop a logit risk score based on BMI, WC, WHtR, and WHR. The ROC analysis was 
      applied to determine the priority of every single index and combined logit score 
      for the prediction of diabetes. Results: All four measures of general and
      abdominal obesity were predictors of diabetes individually in both sexes
      (P=0.0001). Calculation of risk score for a combination of all measures use full 
      model improved predictive power. Adjustment for age resulted in further
      improvement in diagnostic power and combined novel risk score differentiated
      individuals with and without diabetes with an accuracy of 0.747 (95%CI:
      0.690-0.808) in men and 0.789 (95%CI: 0.740, 0.837) in women. Conclusion: These
      findings indicate that the simultaneous calculation of age-adjusted risk score
      for all measures provides stronger diagnostic accuracy in both sexes. This issue 
      suggests the calculation of combined risk scores for all obesity indices
      especially in a population at borderline risk.

TI  - Safety of the use of gold nanoparticles conjugated with proinsulin peptide and
      administered by hollow microneedles as an immunotherapy in type 1 diabetes.
PG  - ltac002
LID - 10.1093/immadv/ltac002 [doi]
AB  - Antigen-specific immunotherapy is an immunomodulatory strategy for autoimmune
      diseases, such as type 1 diabetes, in which patients are treated with
      autoantigens to promote immune tolerance, stop autoimmune beta-cell destruction
      and prevent permanent dependence on exogenous insulin. In this study, human
      proinsulin peptide C19-A3 (known for its positive safety profile) was conjugated 
      to ultrasmall gold nanoparticles (GNPs), an attractive drug delivery platform due
      to the potential anti-inflammatory properties of gold. We hypothesised that
      microneedle intradermal delivery of C19-A3 GNP may improve peptide
      pharmacokinetics and induce tolerogenic immunomodulation and proceeded to
      evaluate its safety and feasibility in a first-in-human trial. Allowing for the
      limitation of the small number of participants, intradermal administration of
      C19-A3 GNP appears safe and well tolerated in participants with type 1 diabetes. 
      The associated prolonged skin retention of C19-A3 GNP after intradermal
      administration offers a number of possibilities to enhance its tolerogenic
      potential, which should be explored in future studies.

TI  - Rice-based breakfast improves fasting glucose and HOMA-IR in Korean adolescents
      who skip breakfast, but breakfast skipping increases aromatic amino acids
      associated with diabetes prediction in Korean adolescents who skip breakfast: a
      randomized, parallel-group, controlled trial.
PG  - 450-463
LID - 10.4162/nrp.2022.16.4.450 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Adolescents who skip breakfast have an increased
      prevalence of chronic diseases. Thus, we aimed to evaluate whether the intake of 
      rice-based breakfast had positive effects on blood glucose indices and to
      determine the possibility of diabetes prevalence in Korean youths who habitually 
      skip breakfast. SUBJECTS/METHODS: In this randomized parallel-group controlled
      trial, 81 subjects who were suitable for compliance among 105 middle-and
      high-school students aged 12-18 years who usually skipped breakfast were included
      in this study (rice-meal group [RMG], n = 26; wheat-meal group [WMG], n = 29;
      general-meal group [GMG], n = 26). The RMG and WMG received a rice-based
      breakfast and a wheat-based breakfast for 12 weeks, respectively. The
      anthropometric indices, blood glucose indices, and metabolites were measured at
      baseline and the endpoint, respectively. RESULTS: The mean body weights in the
      RMG, WMG, and GMG groups at the endpoint were 62.44 kg, 61.80 kg, and 60.28 kg,
      respectively, and the mean body weights of the WMG and GMG groups at the endpoint
      were significantly higher than that at baseline (P < 0.05). The levels of fasting
      insulin and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) values
      were significantly decreased in the RMG group at the endpoint compared to
      baseline (P < 0.05, P < 0.05, respectively). The levels of tryptophan and
      tyrosine in the WMG group at the endpoint were significantly higher than that
      those at baseline (P < 0.01, P < 0.05, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Rice-based
      breakfast has positive effects on fasting insulin levels and HOMA-IR in Korean
      adolescents who skip breakfast. Additionally, it was found that a skipping
      breakfast could increase the prevalence of diabetes in adolescents who skip
      breakfast. Therefore, in addition to reducing breakfast skipping, it is vital to 
      develop a rice-based menu that fits teenage preferences to prevent chronic
      diseases such as diabetes. Trial Registration: Clinical Research Information

AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: The association between nutritional status and
      health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among patients with type 2 diabetes
      mellitus (T2DM) is not fully understood. This study was conducted to understand
      the role of nutritional status on HRQoL among people with and without T2DM.
      SUBJECTS/METHODS: Structured survey and direct measurement of anthropometric data
      were conducted among people with and without T2DM. Nutritional status was
      measured with Mini Nutritional Assessment tool and HRQoL was measured with a
      36-item Short Form Healthy Survey. Data collection was conducted in Chuncheon,
      South Korea with 756 participants who are older than 40 yrs of age. RESULTS: This
      study found that overall HRQoL were significantly lower in people with T2DM than 
      people without T2DM after controlling for key covariates. When stratified by
      nutritional status, a greater degree of negative impact of T2DM on overall
      physical HRQoL was observed among well-nourished or at risk of malnutrition,
      whereas significant and more evident negative impact of diabetes on overall
      psychological HRQoL was observed only among malnourished. CONCLUSIONS: The study 
      results suggest the role of nutritional status among people with T2DM on overall,
      especially psychological aspects of HRQoL. Future longitudinal or intervention
      studies are warranted to test the impact of nutritional status on HRQoL among
      people with T2DM.

TI  - The Effect of Probiotics or Synbiotics on the Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnant 
      Women with Gestational Diabetes: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.
PG  - 94-104
LID - 10.34172/jcs.2021.027 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: Antioxidants and anti-inflammatory drugs have been suggested to
      treat preeclampsia. This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to
      investigate the efficacy of probiotic or synbiotic supplementation on
      hypertensive disorders in women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) .
      Methods: The databases including Cochrane, Embase, Ovid, ProQuest, Scopus, Web of
      Science, and PubMed were systematically searched for collecting the randomized
      controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the efficacy of probiotic or synbiotic
      supplementation versus placebo on hypertensive disorders and pregnancy outcomes
      in GDM until July 2020. Results: Five RCTs with a total sample size of 402 women 
      were included in the meta-analysis. There was no significant decline in systolic 
      blood pressure (standardized mean difference [SMD]=-3.41, 95% confidence interval
      [CI]=-8.32 to 1.50, P=0.17), diastolic blood pressure (SMD=-5.11, 95% CI=-14.20
      to -3.98, P=0.27), preeclampsia (odds ratio [OR]=1.56, 95% CI=0.61 to 3.98,
      P=0.35), cesarean section (OR=0.52, 95% CI=0.18 to 1.50, P=0.23), and macrosomia 
      (OR=0.81, 95% CI=0.41 to 1.57, P=0.53). No significant increase was observed in
      terms of 5-minute Apgar (SMD=0.16, 95% CI=-0.06 to 0.39, P=0.15, I(2)=0%), birth 
      weight (SMD=-0.18, 95% CI=-0.43 to 0.06, P=0.13, I(2)=0%), and gestational age
      (SMD=0.13, 95% CI=-0.11 to 0.37, P=0.28, I(2)=0%). Conclusion: Probiotic or
      synbiotic supplements are not associated with significant effects on pregnancy
      outcomes in GDM. However, due to the limited number of studies in this regard and
      heterogeneity between studies, future high-quality RCTs are recommended.

TI  - Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus exacerbated by COVID-19-induced inflammation is
      the risk factor for COVID-19-associated rhino-orbito-cerebral mucormycosis: A
      matched pair case-control study.
PG  - 3096-3101
LID - 10.4103/ijo.IJO_448_22 [doi]
AB  - Purpose: Amidst the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, India
      experienced an epidemic of COVID-19-associated rhino-orbito-cerebral mucormycosis
      (ROCM). This study aimed to describe the epidemiology and elucidate the risk
      factors for developing COVID-19-associated ROCM, comparing the risk factors among
      COVID-19 patients with and without ROCM. Methods: This case-control study
      included all COVID-19-associated ROCM patients treated at our hospital from May 1
      to July 30, 2021. Controls included age- and sex-matched COVID-19 patients
      without ROCM, who were treated during the same time (exact matching, in 1:2
      ratio). Matched pair analysis using conditional logistic regression was performed
      to examine the association of various risk factors with the development of ROCM
      in COVID-19 patients. Results: The study included 69 patients with
      COVID-19-associated ROCM and 138 age- and gender-matched controls.
      Epidemiologically, COVID-19-associated ROCM predominantly affected males (59/69, 
      85%), in their early 50s (mean 52 years), with 48% (33/69) of patients being from
      medical resource-constrained settings. On multivariate conditional logistic
      regression, elevated serum glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) (odds ratio [OR] = 1.36,
      95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.03-1.78), blood glucose (OR = 1.008, 95% CI:
      1.003-1.013), and C-reactive protein (CRP) (OR = 1.07, 95% CI: 1.02-1.17) were
      associated with increased odds of developing COVID-19-associated ROCM. Patients
      with undetected diabetes mellitus with increasing HbA1c (OR = 3.42, 95% CI:
      1.30-9.02) and blood glucose (OR = 1.02, 95% CI: 1.005-1.03) (P = 0.02) had a
      higher probability of developing COVID-19-associated ROCM than patients with
      established DM. Conclusion: Uncontrolled DM evidenced by elevated HbA1c and blood
      glucose levels, exacerbated by COVID-19-induced proinflammatory state indicated
      by elevated CRP, is the principal independent risk factor for COVID-19-associated
      ROCM. Middle-aged males with undetected DM, from a resource-constraint setting,
      are particularly at risk.

TI  - Diabetic ketoacidosis as first presentation of latent autoimmune diabetes in
      adults in a patient with hashitoxicosis as first presentation of Hashimoto's
      thyroiditis: a case report.
PG  - 297
LID - 10.1186/s13256-022-03523-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Latent autoimmune diabetes in adults is an infrequent form of
      autoimmune diabetes mellitus, while Hashimoto's thyroiditis, the most common
      thyroid disease in adults, rarely manifests as thyrotoxicosis. The concurrent
      initial presentation of these two autoimmune disorders is extremely rare. CASE
      PRESENTATION: A 29-year-old male of Albanian descent presented after being
      hospitalized owing to diabetic ketoacidosis. The diagnosis of type 1 diabetes
      mellitus was placed, and intensified insulin therapy was initiated. Medical
      history was not of significance except a 5 kg weight loss within 2 months. The
      patient presented with recurrent episodes of hypoglycemia, and the doses of
      preprandial and basal insulin were reduced. The differential diagnosis included
      type 1 diabetes mellitus "honeymoon" period or another type of diabetes mellitus.
      His serological tests only revealed positive autoantibodies against glutamic acid
      decarboxylase 65 and C-peptide. The diagnosis leaned toward latent autoimmune
      diabetes in adults, and the therapeutic approach involved cessation of
      preprandial insulin therapy, regulation, and subsequent discontinuation of basal 
      insulin and introduction of metformin. Two years later, basal insulin was
      reintroduced along with a glucagon-like peptide-receptor agonist and metformin.
      Further physical examination during the initial visit disclosed upper limb
      tremor, lid lag, excessive sweating, increased sensitivity to heat, and
      tachycardia. Laboratory tests were indicative of hashitoxicosis (suppressed level
      of thyroid-stimulating hormone, high levels of total and free thyroid hormones,
      positive anti-thyroglobulin and anti-thyroid peroxidase, and negative
      anti-thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor). Thyroid-stimulating hormone level was
      spontaneously restored, but an increase was observed during follow-up.
      Levothyroxine was administrated for 2 years until the patient had normal thyroid 
      function. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of thyroid autoantibodies in patients with 
      latent autoimmune diabetes in adults ranges from 20% to 30%. This correlation can
      be attributed to genetic involvement as well as disorders of immune tolerance to 
      autoantigens. Hence, this report gives prominence to the holistic approach and
      consideration of comorbidities in patients with diabetes mellitus.

TI  - Altered gray matter volume in children with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes
      mellitus.
LID - 10.1038/s41390-022-02227-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) affects the development of cognitive 
      function in children, which may be due to deficits in brain structures or
      functions. It is unclear whether children with T1DM experience alterations in the
      gray matter (GM) structure at the initial stages of the disease. This study
      investigated GM structure alterations in children with newly diagnosed T1DM.
      METHODS: Based on 3D T1-weighted MR images, we investigated the gray matter
      volume (GMV) of 35 newly diagnosed T1DM children and 35 age- and sex-matched
      healthy controls using voxel-based morphometry. The brain regions with
      significant differences in GMV between the newly diagnosed T1DM children and the 
      controls were extracted and the correlation with clinical data was assessed.
      RESULTS: Compared with the control group, children with newly diagnosed T1DM had 
      a lower GMV in the right inferior and middle temporal gyri, right lingual gyrus, 
      and left superior frontal gyrus. In T1DM subjects, the GMV of the right middle
      temporal gyrus was positively correlated with IQ but was negatively correlated
      with HbA1c. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide compelling evidence that GM
      abnormalities occur during early disease stages in T1DM children, which may be a 
      potential neurobiological mechanism underlying cognitive deficits. IMPACT: Using 
      an efficient method to analyze gray matter changes in T1DM is very important. The
      anterior, posterior, and temporal brain regions are susceptible to T1DM in
      children. Recent glucose variability may affect regional gray matter volume in
      children with newly diagnosed T1DM. Structural changes were documented in the
      gray matter of the brain even at the early stages of the disease in children with
      T1DM.

AB  - To explore the distribution of several bone metabolic indicators in type 2
      diabetes patients (T2DM) with and without non-alcoholic fatty liver disease
      (NAFLD) and to preliminarily evaluate the relationship of bone metabolism with
      NAFLD in patients with T2DM. The hospitalized patients with T2DM were divided
      into the group of T2DM complicated with NAFLD and the group of T2DM alone
      according to the results of ultrasonic diagnosis. The general information and
      laboratory test data such as bone metabolism indexes of these patients were
      collected and the differences of the indexes between the 2 groups were compared. 
      Furthermore, the independent influencing factors of NAFLD in patients with T2DM
      were analyzed. A total of 186 patients were included in the study. Compared with 
      patients with T2DM only, patients with T2DM combined with NAFLD were
      characterized with younger age (p < 0.001), higher BMI (p = 0.016), ALT (p =
      0.001), TG (p = 0.005), HOMA-IR (p = 0.005), and lower HDL-C (p = 0.031).
      Significant discrepancy of age (OR 1.052, p = 0.001), ALT (OR 0.964, p = 0.047), 
      HOMA-IR (OR 0.801, p = 0.005), and T-PINP (OR 1.022, p = 0.008) was found using
      multivariate logistic regression model. Significant discrepancy of T-PINP was
      found in T2DM patients with and without NAFLD. Further studies are needed to
      explore whether T-PINP could be used as a predictor of fatty liver disease,
      osteoporosis, and other related complications in patients with T2DM.

AB  - Due to the inflammatory nature of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and the
      increased cardiovascular risk, there is a growing need for innovative strategies 
      to change our identification and treatment approach to avoid clinical
      complications. One approach would be the use of circulating biomarkers to track
      disease progression and management. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the
      concentrations of inflammatory biomarkers in patients diagnosed with type 2
      diabetes mellitus and systemic arterial hypertension, correlating inflammatory
      cytokines and disease severity. Initially, 259 individuals were stratified into
      different degrees of disease: low risk, moderate risk, high risk, and very high
      risk, according to the European Society of Cardiology, which correlates blood
      pressure values with the presence of cardiovascular risk factors. For this
      stratification, analysis of body composition, blood pressure measurement, and
      questionnaires were applied. Blood was collected for biochemical measurements and
      for ELISA to detect concentrations of cytokines IL-17, IL-1beta, IFN-Y,
      TNF-alpha, and IL-10. The findings suggest that inflammation is present,
      contributing to the worsening of systemic arterial hypertension and type 2
      diabetes mellitus. Through Bayesian analysis, we found that hyperglycemia plays a
      role in fueling inflammation, contributing to the maintenance of the state of
      dysregulation and persistent inflammation, which can contribute to systemic
      damage. Our work correlates biochemical, glycemic, body composition, blood
      pressure and inflammatory profiles, showing how they participate together in
      worsening the prognosis of patients diagnosed with chronic non-communicable
      diseases. We have seen that all these parameters can be changed with the practice
      of physical activity, even in conditions of obesity, hyperglycemia or
      dyslipidemia, when patients do not control the changes with standard
      pharmacological treatment. Thus, the management measures of these chronic
      non-communicable diseases must take into account the crosstalk between the
      systems, and the dysregulation of just one of these systems is enough to generate
      consequences in all the other systems.

AB  - AIM: To investigate the relationship between circulating growth-differentiation
      factor (GDF-15) levels and the risk of cardiovascular disease and cancer in
      people with diabetes. METHODS: Totally, 510 participants with type 2 diabetes
      were enrolled from the long-term follow-up of the Da Qing Impaired Glucose
      Tolerance (IGT) and Diabetes Study (2006-2009). Plasma GDF-15 levels were
      assessed. Outcomes of cardiovascular events, cancer, and related death were
      followed up until 2016. RESULTS: Over a 7.5-year follow-up period, 143 (28.0%) of
      the participants died, and 155 and 56 experienced cardiovascular events and
      cancer respectively. Multivariable Cox analysis showed that higher circulating
      GDF-15 levels were significantly associated with the increased risk of
      cardiovascular and cancer death. The HRs after adjustment of traditional
      confounders were 1.90 (95% CI 1.31-2.74) and 2.50 (95% CI 1.34-4.67) respectively
      for an increase in one unit of loge transformed GDF-15 (pg/ml). The
      cause-specific hazard model analysis further confirmed the results after
      adjusting the same confounders. In addition, the higher GDF-15 levels were also
      significantly associated with the increased risk of cardiovascular events
      (HR=1.35, 95% CI: 1.04-1.76) and cancer (HR=1.62, 95% CI 1.06-2.47). CONCLUSIONS:
      Elevated circulating levels of GDF-15 predicted a significant increase in the
      dual risk of cancer and cardiovascular diseases in Chinese people with type 2
      diabetes. Thus, it may be a potential predictor of these outcomes in people with 
      diabetes.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Although diabetes mellitus (DM) is considered to be an important
      prognostic factor in spinal surgery, the relationship between these two factors
      remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether diabetes is
      associated with an increased risk of postoperative complications in patients
      undergoing spinal surgery. METHODS: We systematically searched the PubMed,
      Embase, and Cochrane Library for relevant articles published on or before
      December 25, 2021. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs)
      were calculated using random effects meta-analysis. The primary outcome was the
      risk of postoperative complications following spinal surgery, including
      postoperative infection and reoperation. Furthermore, we conducted subgroup
      analyses and leave-one-out sensitivity analyses to explore the main sources of
      heterogeneity and the stability of the results. RESULTS: A total of 40 cohort
      studies including 2,998,891 participants met the inclusion criteria.
      Meta-analysis showed that diabetes was significantly associated with
      postoperative infection (OR 2.21, 95% CI 1.70-2.88, p < 0.001) and reoperation
      (OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.12-1.64, p = 0.002). Furthermore, the results also found that 
      diabetes was significantly associated with surgery-related death (OR 1.61, 95% CI
      1.13-2.30, p = 0.008) and transfusions (OR 1.39, 95% CI 1.11-1.75, p = 0.005),
      whereas diabetes failed to account for nervous system complications (OR 1.12, 95%
      CI 0.82-1.52, p = 0.470) and embolism (OR 1.15, 95% CI 0.83-1.60, p = 0.386) for 
      patients following spine surgery. These results were further confirmed by the
      trim-and-fill procedure and leave-one-out sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS:
      Diabetes appears to be a risk factor for postoperative infection and reoperation 
      for patients following spinal surgery. Special attention should be devoted to
      reducing the occurrence of postoperative complications in diabetic patients
      undergoing spinal surgery.

AB  - AIMS: To characterize the prevalence of NAFLD among subjects with NGT,
      prediabetes and type 2 diabetes (T2DM) by sex in adults with one or more
      cardio-metabolic risk factors, and to assess whether cardio-metabolic factors
      explained sex-related differences in NAFLD prevalence. METHODS: The study sample 
      encompasses 742 individuals with NGT, 553 with prediabetes, and 431 with T2DM.
      RESULTS: Women with prediabetes and T2DM exhibited greater relative differences
      in waist circumference, HOMA-IR, hsCRP, and lipid profile than prediabetic and
      diabetic men when compared with their NGT counterparts. Formal tests for glucose 
      tolerance status x sex interaction were statistically significant for waist
      circumference (P = 0.008), HOMA-IR (P = 0.03), total cholesterol (P = 0.003), LDL
      (P = 0.001), HDL (P = 0.006), triglycerides (P < 0.0001), and hsCRP (P < 0.05).
      In a logistic regression analysis, prediabetic and diabetic women exhibited a
      higher OR for NAFLD than their male counterparts with test for glucose tolerance 
      status x sex interaction being statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS:
      Prediabetic and diabetic women have higher OR of having NAFLD than men.
      Deterioration of glucose homeostasis in women is associated with a greater
      worsening in metabolic risk factors than men, which may explain the stronger
      impact of prediabetes and T2DM on NAFLD in women.

AB  - AIMS: To compare quality of care for type 2 diabetes in people with severe mental
      illness (SMI) versus no mental illness. METHODS: We used routinely collected
      linked data to create a retrospective cohort study. We included 158,901 people
      diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in Scotland during 2009-2018 of whom 1701 (1%),
      768 (0.5%) and 5211 (3%) had a prior hospital admission record for schizophrenia,
      bipolar disorder, and major depression, respectively. We compared recording of
      HbA1c, cholesterol, creatinine, blood pressure, urinary albumin, foot
      examination, retinopathy screening, body mass index and smoking during the first 
      year after diabetes diagnosis using logistic regression and recording of HbA1c
      and retinopathy screening over longer follow-up using generalised linear mixed
      effects model, adjusting for confounding factors. RESULTS: Receipt of care during
      the first year was generally similar, or better, for people with each SMI than
      for people without any mental illness. During mean follow up of 4.8 (SD 2.5)
      years, depression and bipolar disorder were associated with lower odds of
      receiving retinopathy screening. CONCLUSIONS: Receipt of diabetes care was
      similar or better among people with SMI versus without SMI. However, mechanisms
      to support improved retinopathy screening for people with SMI are needed.

AB  - Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a general term for heterogeneous metabolic disorders
      whose main characteristic is chronic hyperglycemia. Considering that conventional
      diagnostic methods are currently unable of early DM detection and the number of
      diabetic patients has been increasing worldwide, there is a clinical need for
      novel diagnostic approaches. Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy
      technique an alternative non-invasive diagnostic method for real-time evaluation 
      of biofluids such as saliva. This study aims evaluate the feasibility of
      diagnosing diabetes and periodontitis through saliva samples based on their FT-IR
      spectra. Our first collection and spectral analysis of samples was a pilot study 
      and comprised a total of 23 patients, 2 healthy, 9 with diabetes and 12 with
      diabetes and periodontitis. By using weighted KNN as classifier, we have obtained
      an area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve of 0.92 and 0.95 when
      considering the diabetes or diabetes+periodontitis groups as positive groups,
      respectively.

      diabetes in Finnish Diabetes Prevention Study.
LID - dgac463 [pii]
LID - 10.1210/clinem/dgac463 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Circulating branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) are
      associated with the risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D). We examined to what extent
      lifestyle intervention aiming to prevent T2D interacts with this association and 
      how BCAA concentrations change during the intervention. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We
      comprised trajectory clusters by k-means clustering of serum fasting BCAAs
      analysed annually by mass spectrometry during four-year intervention. We
      investigated whether baseline BCAAs, BCAA trajectories and BCAA change
      trajectories predict T2D and whether BCAAs predict T2D differently in the
      intervention (n=198) and control group (n=196). RESULTS: Elevated baseline BCAAs 
      predicted the incidence of T2D in the control group (HR 1.05 per 10 mumol/l,
      p=0.01), but not in the intervention group. BCAA concentration decreased during
      the first year in the whole cohort (mean -14.9 mumol/l, p<0.001), with no
      significant difference between the groups. We identified five BCAA trajectory
      clusters and five trajectory clusters for the change in BCAAs. Trajectories with 
      high mean BCAA levels were associated with an increased HR for T2D compared with 
      the trajectory with low BCAA levels (trajectory with highest vs lowest BCAA, HR
      4.0; p-value 0.01). A trajectory with increasing BCAA levels had a higher HR for 
      T2D compared with decreasing trajectory in the intervention group only (HR 25.4, 
      p-value <0.001). CONCLUSION: Lifestyle intervention modified the association of
      the baseline BCAA concentration and BCAA trajectories with the incidence of T2D. 
      Our study adds to the accumulating evidence on the mechanisms behind the effect
      of lifestyle changes on the risk of T2D.

TI  - A randomized controlled trial of R-form verapamil added to ongoing metformin
      therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes.
LID - dgac436 [pii]
LID - 10.1210/clinem/dgac436 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: There is a medical need for effective insulin-independent antidiabetic
      drugs that have the capability to promote pancreatic beta-cell function and have 
      a low risk of hypoglycemia in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients. R-form
      verapamil (R-Vera), which is able to enhance the survival of beta-cells and has
      higher cardiovascular safety margin compared to racemic verapamil, was developed 
      as a novel approach for the T2DM treatment. OBJECTIVE: This randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was designed to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of three doses of R-Vera added to ongoing metformin therapy
      in T2DM patients who had inadequate glycemic control on metformin alone. METHODS:
      Subjects were randomly assigned in an equal ratio to receive R-Vera 450, 300, 150
      mg per day or matching placebo, in combination with metformin. The primary
      endpoint was change in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) after 12 weeks of treatment.
      RESULTS: A total of 184 eligible subjects were randomized to receive either
      R-Vera or placebo plus metformin. At week 12, significant reductions in HbA1c
      were observed for R-Vera 300 mg/day (-0.36, P = 0.0373) and 450 mg/day (-0.45, P 
      = 0.0098) compared to placebo. The reduction in HbA1c correlated with decreasing 
      fasting plasma glucose levels and improved HOMA2-beta score. Treatment with
      R-Vera was well tolerated with no hypoglycemic episodes occurring during the
      trial. CONCLUSION: Addition of R-Vera twice daily to ongoing metformin therapy
      significantly improved glycemic control in T2DM patients. The favorable efficacy 
      and safety profile of R-Vera 300 mg/day can be considered as the appropriate dose
      for clinical practice.

LID - 10.1097/GME.0000000000002014 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the associations of a lifetime
      history of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) and gestational diabetes
      mellitus (GDM) with menopausal symptoms in midlife. METHODS: This was a secondary
      analysis of women participating in Project Viva, an ongoing cohort enrolled
      during pregnancy. The exposure was lifetime history of HDP or GDM assessed for
      the index pregnancy by review of outpatient and hospital medical records and for 
      all other pregnancies by interview or questionnaire at study entry (1999-2002)
      and the midlife visit (2017-2021). The primary outcome was the Menopause Rating
      Scale (MRS) applied at the midlife study visit. We used linear or logistic
      regression models adjusted for covariates such as baseline age, race/ethnicity,
      education, married/cohabiting, household income, baseline parity, age at
      menarche, and body mass index at midlife. RESULTS: Of the 676 included
      participants, 120 (18%) had a history of HDP, and 47 (7%) had a history of GDM.
      The mean (SD) age was 52 (3.9) years at the midlife visit, and 48% of the
      participants had experienced menopause. There were no consistent differences in
      total, domain-specific, or individual symptoms in women with a history of HDP or 
      GDM. A history of HDP and/or GDM was not associated with age at the onset of
      natural menopause. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings do not support an association of a
      history of HDP or GDM with the severity of menopausal symptoms or age at the
      onset of natural menopause. Larger studies of women with a history of these
      pregnancy complications are needed to clarify their association with menopausal
      symptoms.

TI  - Acute Ischemic Stroke Comorbid with Type 2 Diabetes: Long-Term Prognosis
      Determinants in a 36-Month Prospective Study for Personalized Medicine.
LID - 10.1089/omi.2022.0071 [doi]
AB  - Ischemic stroke (IS) is often comorbid with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)
      wherein the determinants of long-term outcomes, beyond the acute stroke phase,
      are not adequately known. This study identified the determinants of long-term
      outcomes for diabetic IS patients through a prospective nested case-control study
      in 624 patients treated with conservative measures (38.60% females, mean age:
      63.85 years). After 36-month follow-up, 117 (18.8%) patients with poor outcome
      were enrolled in the case group. The poor outcome was defined with a modified
      Rankin Scale (mRS) score >/=3. Meanwhile, 374 (59.9%) patients with good outcome,
      defined as (mRS score <3), were included in the control group. Patients who died 
      (n = 32) or lost to follow-up (n = 101) were excluded in analysis. Poor
      prognostic outcome was positively associated with (1) the pulse rate at
      admission, (2) diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and (3) fasting blood glucose
      (FBG) during follow-up, whereas physical activity and lipid-lowering treatment
      during follow-up were negatively associated. Importantly, a forecasting model
      with these indicators distinguished the patients with good versus poor outcomes
      with 70.1% sensitivity and 73.5% specificity. Health care professionals and
      laboratory medicine scholars may want to monitor an increase in DBP and FBG
      during follow-up, as well as physical activity and lipid-lowering treatment, in
      relationship to the prognosis of IS with comorbid T2DM after conservative
      therapies. The proposed predictive model for personalized/precision medicine
      requires field testing in independent studies, and might help risk stratification
      with theranostic tests for patients with acute IS who also have a diagnosis of
      T2DM.

PG  - e24627
LID - 10.1002/jcla.24627 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and gestational diabetic
      nephropathy (GDN) have become an increasingly serious problem worldwide, which
      can cause a large number of adverse pregnancy consequences for mothers and
      infants. However, the diagnosis of GDM and GDN remains a challenge due to the
      lack of optimal biomarkers, and the examination has high requirements for patient
      compliance. We aimed to establish a simple early diagnostic model for GDM and
      GDN. METHODS: We recruited 50 healthy pregnant (HP), 99 GDM patients, 99 GDN
      patients at Daping Hospital. Renal function indicators and blood cell indicators 
      were collected for all patients. RESULTS: Compared with HP, GDM, and GDN patients
      exhibited significantly higher urea/creatinine ratio and NEU. The diagnostic
      model1 based on the combination of urea/creatinine ratio and NEU was built using 
      logistic regression. Based on receiver operating characteristic curve analysis,
      the area under the curve (AUC) of the diagnostic model was 0.77 (0.7, 0.84) in
      distinguishing GDM from HP, and the AUC of the diagnostic model was 0.94 (0.9,
      0.97) in distinguishing GDN from HP. Meanwhile, the diagnostic model2 based on
      the combination of beta2-mG, PLT, and NEU in GDM and GDN patients was built using
      logistic regression, and the area under the ROC curve (AUC ROC) was 0.79 (0.73,
      0.85), which was larger than the individual biomarker AUC. CONCLUSION: Our study 
      demonstrated that the diagnostic model established by the combination of renal
      function indicators and blood cell indicators could facilitate the differential
      diagnosis of GDM and GDN patients.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review discusses ways in which the electronic health
      record (EHR) can offer clinical decision support (CDS) tools for management of
      inpatient diabetes and hyperglycemia. RECENT FINDINGS: The use of electronic
      order sets can help providers order comprehensive basal bolus insulin regimens
      that are consistent with current guidelines. Order sets have been shown to reduce
      insulin errors and hypoglycemia rates. They can also help set glycemic targets,
      give hemoglobin A1C reminders, guide weight-based dosing, and match insulin
      regimen to nutritional profile. Glycemic management dashboards allow multiple
      variables affecting blood glucose to be shown in a single view, which allows for 
      efficient evaluation of glucose trends and adjustment of insulin regimen. With
      the use glycemic management dashboards, active surveillance and remote management
      also become feasible. Hypoglycemia prevention and management are another part of 
      inpatient diabetes management that is enhanced by EHR CDS tools. Furthermore,
      diagnosis and management of diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperglycemia hyperosmolar 
      state are improved with the aid of EHR CDS tools. The use of EHR CDS tools helps 
      improve the care of patients with diabetes and hyperglycemia in the inpatient
      hospital setting.

TI  - Personalised prevention of type 2 diabetes.
LID - 10.1007/s00125-022-05774-7 [doi]
AB  - It is well established from clinical trials that behavioural interventions can
      halve the risk of progression from prediabetes to type 2 diabetes but translating
      this evidence of efficacy into effective real-world interventions at scale is an 
      ongoing challenge. A common suggestion is that future preventive interventions
      need to be more personalised in order to enhance effectiveness. This review
      evaluates the degree to which existing interventions are already personalised and
      outlines how greater personalisation could be achieved through better
      identification of those at high risk, division of type 2 diabetes into specific
      subgroups and, above all, more individualisation of the behavioural targets for
      preventive action. Approaches using more dynamic real-time data are in their
      scientific infancy. Although these approaches are promising they need longer-term
      evaluation against clinical outcomes. Whatever personalised preventive approaches
      for type 2 diabetes are developed in the future, they will need to be
      complementary to existing individual-level interventions that are being rolled
      out and that are demonstrably effective. They will also need to ideally synergise
      with, and at the very least not detract attention from, efforts to develop and
      implement strategies that impact on type 2 diabetes risk at the societal level.

TI  - Capturing Diabetes-Related Distress and Burden From the Perspective of Patients
      With Type 1 or Type 2 Diabetes: Protocol for an Explorative Mixed Methods Study.
PG  - e38477
LID - 10.2196/38477 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetes is one of the most common diseases worldwide and is
      associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and reduced quality of life. Many
      patients experience high diabetes-related distress as well as depression and
      anxiety symptoms, which are associated with poor diabetes self-management. As
      disease management is a central component in diabetes treatment, poor management 
      enhances the occurrence of micro- and macrovascular complications. This
      emphasizes the relevance of reducing diabetes-related distress and providing
      adequate treatment options addressing the individual psychosocial burden of
      patients with diabetes. Since patients' perspectives diverge significantly from
      those of practitioners in terms of relevant treatment aspects, the patient
      perspective on, for example, barriers to and facilitators of diabetes treatment
      is crucial for adequate and effective treatment as well as improvements to
      self-management and therefore, needs to be further explored. OBJECTIVE: This
      study aims to examine diabetes-related distress, the course of distress
      throughout diabetes management, as well as barriers and facilitating factors in
      dealing with diabetes from the individual perspective of patients with type 1 and
      type 2 diabetes. METHODS: The study employs a mixed methods design combining
      qualitative and quantitative data. Semistructured interviews (N=40) will be
      conducted with patients with type 1 diabetes (n=20) and patients with type 2
      diabetes (n=20). The primary outcomes comprise (1) diabetes-related distress, (2)
      the severity of distress, (3) the course of distress throughout diabetes
      management, (4) barriers, and (5) facilitating factors. Questionnaires will
      provide data on the following secondary outcomes: diabetes-related emotional
      distress (the Problem Areas in Diabetes scale), symptoms of depression and
      anxiety (Patient Health Questionnaire, German version), personality functioning
      (Operationalized Psychodynamic Diagnosis-Structure Questionnaire), mentalizing
      capacities (Mentalization Questionnaire), epistemic trust (Epistemic Trust,
      Mistrust and Credulity Questionnaire) and experiences of child maltreatment
      (Childhood Trauma Questionnaire), and the overall health status of the patient
      (routine medical data). RESULTS: As of April 2022, the conceptualization phase of
      the study was finalized. Ethics approval was received in January 2022 from the
      local ethics committee of the Justus Liebig University Giessen - Faculty of
      Medicine (AZ 161/21). CONCLUSIONS: This study will provide insights into the
      individual perspective of patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes regarding
      their experiences with diabetes management and what they perceive to be relevant,
      obstructive, or beneficial. The insights gained could help further tailor
      diabetes treatment to the individual needs of patients with diabetes and
      therefore optimize diabetes self-management. TRIAL REGISTRATION: German Clinical

TI  - Self-care behaviours among people with type 2 diabetes mellitus in South Asia: A 
      systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 04056
LID - 10.7189/jogh.12.04056 [doi]
AB  - Background: The burden of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) in South Asian
      countries is increasing rapidly. Self-care behaviour plays a vital role in
      managing T2DM and preventing complications. Research on self-care behaviours
      among people with T2DM has been widely conducted in South Asian countries, but
      there are no systematic reviews that assess self-care behaviour among people with
      T2DM in South Asia. This study systematically assessed the studies reporting
      self-care behaviours among people with T2DM in South-Asia. Methods: Adhering to
      the PRISMA guidelines, we searched six bibliographic databases (Scopus, PubMed,
      CINAHL, Embase, Web of Science, and PsychInfo) to identify the relevant articles 
      published between January 2000 through March 2022. Eligibility criteria included 
      all observational and cross-sectional studies reporting on the prevalence of
      self-care behaviours (ie, diet, physical activity, medication adherence, blood
      glucose monitoring, and foot care) conducted in South Asian countries among
      people with T2DM. Results: The database search returned 1567 articles. After
      deduplication (n = 758) and review of full-text articles (n = 192), 92 studies
      met inclusion criteria and were included. Forward and backward reference checks
      were performed on included studies, which resulted in an additional 18 articles. 
      The pooled prevalence of adherence to blood glucose monitoring was 65% (95% CI = 
      49-80); 64% for medication adherence (95% CI = 53-74); 53% for physical activity 
      (95% CI = 39-66); 48% for diet (95% CI = 38-58); 42% for foot care (95% CI =
      30-54). About a quarter of people with T2DM consumed alcohol (25.2%, IQR =
      13.8%-38.1%) and were using tobacco products (18.6%, IQR = 10.6%-23.8%).
      Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the prevalence of self-care behaviours
      among people with T2DM in South Asia is low. This shows an urgent need to
      thoroughly investigate the barriers to the practising of self-care and design and
      implement interventions to improve diabetes self-care behaviour among people with
      T2DM in South Asia.

TI  - Experiences of Using Wearable Continuous Glucose Monitors in Adults With
      Diabetes: A Qualitative Descriptive Study.
PG  - 26350106221116899
LID - 10.1177/26350106221116899 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of the study was to understand the experiences of adults
      with diabetes wearing a continuous glucose monitor (CGM). METHODS: This
      qualitative, descriptive study included 19 adults with type 1 diabetes or type 2 
      diabetes, who had used the FreeStyle Libre CGM for at least 4 weeks, from an
      outpatient clinic at a university-affiliated hospital in Korea. Data were
      collected through in-depth interviews and analyzed using an inductive content
      analysis approach. RESULTS: The content analysis revealed 3 major
      themes-navigating glucose level fluctuations, reframing diabetes self-care and
      improving quality of life, and device improvement and service quality.
      Participants reported that CGMs offered convenient glucose level monitoring,
      allowed early response to rapid glucose changes, and facilitated effective
      patient-clinician communication. Participants expressed concerns about the
      financial burden and limited services, recommending improvements for devices,
      consumer services, and health insurance coverage. CONCLUSIONS: Study findings
      indicated that using wearable CGMs could improve self-care and quality of life in
      adults with diabetes. Using CGMs could improve patients' understanding of how
      diabetes self-care management affects real-time glucose levels. Health care
      providers could support patients' self-care by using device data. Improvements in
      quality, services, and insurance coverage could increase user satisfaction and
      promote self-care.

TI  - Sjogren syndrome is a hidden contributor of macrovascular and microvascular
      complications in patients with type 2 diabetes.
LID - 10.1111/1756-185X.14400 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate cardiovascular risk among diabetic patients with
      Sjogren syndrome. METHODS: This study was a nationwide population-based
      case-control study from 1997 to 2013, in which the association between autoimmune
      diseases and diabetes was investigated. The study population consisted of
      individuals with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes with macrovascular or
      microvascular complications with at least two outpatient visits or one
      hospitalization as the outcome variables, and the exposure variables included
      traditional risk factors, medications, and autoimmune diseases. The odds ratio of
      cardiovascular events among each prevalent autoimmune disease and
      hydroxychloroquine's effect on cardiovascular risk were analyzed. RESULTS: The
      study included a total of 7026 individuals with diabetes with microvascular and
      macrovascular complications and the same number of patients in the control group.
      Sjogren syndrome was significantly higher in the diabetes complication group than
      in the non-complication group (0.8% vs 0.5%, P = 0.036). By using multivariate
      analysis, we found hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and Sjogren syndrome to be three
      independent risk factors for diabetes vascular complications (odds ratio [OR]
      1.96, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.82-2.10; OR 1.53, 95% CI 1.42-1.64; and OR
      1.67, 95% CI 1.06-2.65; respectively, all P < 0.05). Treatment with traditional
      statins and aspirin might be able to overcome the increased risk of developing
      cardiovascular events while comparing between diabetes patients with and without 
      Sjogren syndrome. CONCLUSION: Sjogren syndrome is an unrecognized independent
      risk factor for cardiovascular events among diabetes patients, which indicates
      that patients with diabetes combined with Sjogren syndrome require closer follow 
      up regarding cardiovascular complications in clinical settings. Treatment with
      hydroxychloroquine might not be enough to lower the cardiovascular risk
      significantly in diabetes patients with Sjogren syndrome.

TI  - German Diabetes Risk Score for the Determination of the Individual Type 2
      Diabetes Risk.
LID - 10.3238/arztebl.m2022.0268 [doi]
LID - arztebl.m2022.0268 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The German Diabetes Risk Score (GDRS) currently enables prediction of
      the individual risk of developing type 2 diabetes (T2D) within five years. The
      aim of this study is to extend the prediction period of the GDRS, including its
      non-clinical version and its HbA1c extension, to 10 years, and to perform
      external validation. METHODS: In data from the Brandenburg Nutrition and Cancer
      Study (EPIC)-Potsdam (n = 25 393), Cox proportional hazards regression was used
      to reweight the points that were used to calculate the five-year risk. Two
      population-based prospective cohorts (EPIC-Heidelberg n = 23 624, BGS98 cohort n 
      = 3717) were used for external validation. Discrimination was represented by
      C-indices, and calibration by calibration plots and the expected-to-observed
      (E/O) ratio. RESULTS: Prediction performance in EPIC-Potsdam was very good
      (C-index for the non-clinical model: 0.834) and was confirmed in EPIC-Heidelberg 
      (0.843) and in the BGS98 cohort (0.851). Among persons in the BGS98 cohort with a
      greater than 10% predicted probability of disease, 14.9% developed T2D within 10 
      years (positive predictive value). The models were very well calibrated in
      EPIC-Potsdam (E/O ratio for the non-clinical model: 1.08), slightly overestimated
      the risk in EPIC-Heidelberg (1.34), and predicted T2D very well in the BGS98
      cohort after recalibration (1.06). CONCLUSION: The extended GDRS prediction
      period of 10 years, with a non-clinical version and an HbA1c extension that will 
      soon be available in both German and English, enables the even longer-range,
      evidence-based identification of high-risk individuals with many different
      applications, including medical screening.

PG  - 7083106
LID - 10.1155/2022/7083106 [doi]
AB  - Studies on nutrient sequences during meals suggest that consuming carbohydrates
      last lowers postprandial glucose excursions more than consuming carbohydrates
      first. However, this phenomenon has not been studied in gestational diabetes
      mellitus (GDM). Ten women with GDM consumed the same caloric foods in different
      sequences over five successive days: (A) dish first, followed by carbohydrate and
      soup last; (B) carbohydrate first, followed by dish and soup last; (C) soup
      first, followed by dish and carbohydrate last; (D) three meals a day ad libitum; 
      and (E) six meals a day as ad libitum. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) was
      used to assess diurnal glycemia. Decreases in mean glucose levels and the largest
      glucose levels in A were similar to group C. The peak glucose of breakfast and
      lunch in group B was more significant than in groups A and C. The B meal pattern 
      showed more marked glycemic excursions than groups A and C. Increasing the number
      of meals reduced the peak glucose level and the glycemic excursions with the same
      total calories. Changing meal sequences or increasing the number of meals may
      reduce glycemic excursions in GDM. Our trial was registered retrospectively and
      the trial registration number is ChiCTR2200057044.

      in Iran.
PG  - 1-7
LID - 10.1007/s40200-022-01103-2 [doi]
AB  - Purpose: Diabetes-related distress (DRD) has negative emotional effects on the
      patients' quality of life. This is while the condition often goes undiagnosed
      despite it being common among diabetic patients. This study investigated the
      prevalence of DRD and its association with diabetes complications among a group
      of Iranian type 2 diabetic patients (T2DM). Methods: This descriptive-analytical 
      cross-sectional study was conducted on 186 T2DM patients referred to a diabetes
      clinic in a teaching hospital from the beginning of May 2019 to the end of April 
      2020. Two questionnaires on disease-related information and diabetes distress
      screening scale (DDS) were filled out for each patient. The latter was divided
      into four domains, emotional burden (EB), diabetes-related interpersonal distress
      (ID), physician-related distress (PD), and regimen-related distress (RD). In
      addition to the frequency of DRD and its association with age, sex, body mass
      index (BMI), hypertension, hemoglobin A1C, duration of disease, and type of
      medication regimen (oral, insulin, or mix) along with the history of
      cardiovascular disease (CVDs), retinopathy, nephropathy, and diabetic foot were
      assessed. Results: DRD was reported in 47% of the patients. Being female, old
      age, hypertension, high hemoglobin A1C levels, nephropathy, and retinopathy were 
      significantly associated with DRD (P-value = < 0.001, 0.013, 0.014, 0.007, 0.001,
      and 0.004, respectively). The history of the diabetic foot had a significant
      relationship with PD and ID (P-value = 0.007 and < 0.001, respectively).
      Multivariate regression showed gender and the existence of complications to have 
      a direct effect on the development of DRD. Conclusion: DRD prevalence is
      relatively high and requires screening to identify and treat high-risk patients. 
      Further studies are needed to study diabetes, its complications and their
      relation with DRD to help reduce such conditions and improve the patient's
      quality of life.

PG  - 26350106221116023
LID - 10.1177/26350106221116023 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of the study was to examine the factors associated with
      diabetes self-care behaviors (DSCB) in people with visual impairment (PVI),
      including demographics, disease-related characteristics, and psychosocial factors
      (self-efficacy, depression, and family support). METHODS: A descriptive
      cross-sectional study was conducted. Adults with visual impairment and diabetes
      were recruited online and through posting notices, and a total of 141
      participants were included. Measurements were completed using email and telephone
      surveys. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to examine the factors
      associated with DSCB. RESULTS: Higher self-efficacy and positive family support
      were significant predictors of better DSCB, whereas higher negative family
      support was a significant predictor of worse DSCB. Diabetes medication regimen
      was another major influencing factor on DSCB. However, depression was not
      associated with DSCB. CONCLUSION: Diabetes interventions for the visually
      impaired should have strategies to improve vulnerable areas of diabetes
      self-care, such as blood glucose monitoring. Health care providers are needed to 
      consider diabetes education programs focused on improving self-efficacy or
      include family members in interventions to promote DSCB in PVI. Further studies
      are required to understand the problems and solutions for diabetes self-care in
      this population.

TI  - Diabetes Prevalence, Risk Factors, and Care in Asian American and Pacific
      Islanders of Texas: Data From the 2015-2019 Behavioral Risk Factors Surveillance 
      System.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the health status and needs
      of the Asian American/Pacific Islander (AAPI) population with diabetes in Texas. 
      METHODS: This was a cross-sectional secondary analysis of data collected from the
      Behavioral Risk Factors Surveillance System in Texas from 2015 to 2019 for
      non-Hispanic White (NHW) and AAPI adults. RESULTS: Although the overall crude
      diabetes prevalence was lower in AAPI adults, age-adjusted diabetes prevalence
      was higher than in NHWs. Significant risk factors associated with diabetes in the
      AAPI group included being male, marital status, lower education levels, lower
      income, being overweight/obese, and having a sedentary lifestyle. Engagement in
      self-management activities (checking blood glucose, checking feet, attending a
      diabetes management course) was lower in AAPIs than in NHWs. CONCLUSIONS: Given
      stiff barriers to adequate screening and self-management support in diabetes care
      among ethnic populations such as AAPIs, targeted efforts to improve diabetes
      screening and effective care are warranted. Because today's AAPI populations are 
      predominantly first-generation immigrant groups who suffer from language
      barriers, efforts should be made to develop health surveys in multiple languages 
      for wider inclusion of understudied groups like AAPIs in diabetes-related
      research.

TI  - The need for screening, early diagnosis, and prediction of chronic kidney disease
      in people with diabetes in low- and middle-income countries-a review of the
      current literature.
PG  - 247
LID - 10.1186/s12916-022-02438-6 [doi]
AB  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) in people with diabetes is becoming an increasing
      major public health concern, disproportionately burdening low- and middle-income 
      countries (LMICs). This rising burden is due to various factors, including the
      lack of disease awareness that results in late referral and the cost of screening
      and consequent treatment of the comorbid conditions, as well as other factors
      endemic to LMICs relating to inadequate management of risk factors. We critically
      assessed the extant literature, by performing searches of Medline via PubMed,
      EBSCOhost, Scopus, and Web of Science, for studies pertaining to screening,
      diagnosis, and prediction of CKD amongst adults with diabetes in LMICs, using
      relevant key terms. The relevant studies were summarized through key themes
      derived from the Wilson and Jungner criteria. We found that screening for CKD in 
      people with diabetes is generally infrequent in LMICs. Also, LMICs are
      ill-equipped to appropriately manage diabetes-associated CKD, especially its late
      stages, in which supportive care and kidney replacement therapy (KRT) might be
      required. There are acceptable and relatively simple tools that can aid
      diabetes-associated CKD screening in these countries; however, these tools come
      with limitations. Thus, effective implementation of diabetes-associated CKD
      screening in LMICs remains a challenge, and the cost-effectiveness of such an
      undertaking largely remains to be explored. In conclusion, for many compelling
      reasons, screening for CKD in people with diabetes should be a high policy
      priority in LMICs, as the huge cost associated with higher mortality and
      morbidity in this group and the cost of KRT offers a compelling economic
      incentive for improving early detection of diabetes in CKD.

TI  - Quantitative and qualitative analysis of the quality of life of Type 1 diabetes
      patients using insulin pumps and of those receiving multiple daily insulin
      injections.
PG  - 120
LID - 10.1186/s12955-022-02029-2 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Insulin pump therapy represents an alternative to multiple daily
      injections and can improve glycemic control and quality of life (QoL) in Type 1
      diabetes mellitus (T1DM) patients. We aimed to explore the differences and
      factors related to the T1DM-specific QoL of such patients in Latvia. DESIGN AND
      METHODS: A mixed-method cross-sectional study on 87 adult T1DM patients included 
      20 pump users and 67 users of injections who participated in the quantitative
      part of the study; 8 pump users and 13 injection users participated in the
      qualitative part. Patients were invited to participate using a dedicated digital 
      platform. Their QoL and self-management habits were assessed using specially
      developed questionnaires adapted to Latvian conditions. Multiple logistic
      regression models were built to investigate the association between social and
      self-management factors and patients' QoL. In addition, qualitative analysis of
      answers was performed. RESULTS: Insulin pump users were younger, had higher
      incomes, and reported higher T1DM expenses than users of multiple daily
      injections. There were no differences in self-management between the groups;
      Total QoL differed at the 0.1 significance level. In fully adjusted multiple
      logistic regression models, the most important factor that increased Total QoL
      was lower T1DM-related expenses (odds ratio, OR 7.02 [95% confidence interval
      1.29; 38.0]). Men and those with more years of living with T1DM had better QoL
      (OR 9.62 [2.20; 42.1] and OR 1.16 [1.05; 1.29], respectively), but the method of 
      administration was not significantly associated with QoL (OR 7.38 [0.87; 62.9]). 
      Qualitative data supported the results of quantitative analysis. CONCLUSIONS: QoL
      was the main reason to use an insulin pump, while the expense was the main reason
      to avoid the use of it or to stop using it. Reimbursement policies thus should be
      considered to enable patients to choose the more convenient method for
      themselves.

PG  - 774
LID - 10.1038/s42003-022-03728-8 [doi]
AB  - While the exact mechanism remains unclear, type 2 diabetes mellitus increases the
      risk of sarcopenia which is characterized by decreased muscle mass, strength, and
      function. Whole-transcriptome RNA sequencing and informatics were performed on
      the diabetes-induced sarcopenia model of db/db mice. To determine the specific
      function of lncRNA Gm20743, the detection of Mito-Sox, reactive oxygen species,
      Ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine, and myosin heavy chain was performed in overexpressed
      and knockdown-Gm20743 C2C12 cells. RNA-seq data and informatics revealed the key 
      lncRNA-mRNA interactions and indicated a potential regulatory role of lncRNAs. We
      characterized three core candidate lncRNAs Gm20743, Gm35438, 1700047G03Rik, and
      their potential function. Furthermore, the results suggested lncRNA Gm20743 may
      be involved in regulating mitochondrial function, oxidative stress, cell
      proliferation, and myotube differentiation in skeletal muscle cells. These
      findings significantly improve our understanding of lncRNAs that may mediate
      muscle mass, strength, and function in diabetes and represent potential
      therapeutic targets for diabetes-induced sarcopenia.

TI  - Vitamin B12 and Gestational Diabetes Mellitus: A Systematic Review and
      Meta-analysis.
PG  - 1-19
LID - 10.1017/S000711452200246X [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: With increasing focus on vitamin B12 and gestational
      diabetes mellitus (GDM) recently, their relationship remains controversial. To
      comprehensively evaluate the relationship between vitamin B12 and GDM, and to
      provide more information on GDM prevention, this study provides a systematic
      review and meta-analysis of vitamin B12 and GDM. METHODS: As of September 22,
      2021, 304 articles were searched in PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, and Cochrane 
      databases, of which 15 studies met the inclusion criteria. The keywords were
      vitamin B 12 and Diabetes, Gestational. Data were analyzed using R 4.1.0
      software. Relative risks were analyzed using random and fixed-effects models to
      analyze mean differences (MD) for continuous variables; odds ratios (OR) of
      exposures and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Subgroup analysis was used to
      identify heterogeneity. RESULTS: There was no association between maternal
      vitamin B12 concentration during the first trimester with GDM, however, low
      vitamin B12 concentration in the second or third trimester of pregnancy was
      related to an increased risk of GDM. Compared with the non-GDM group, the vitamin
      B12 concentration in the GDM group was remarkably decreased (MD: -10.79; 95%CI:
      -21.37, -0.21), and vitamin B12 deficiency increased the risk for GDM (OR: 1.59; 
      95%CI: 1.10, 2.29). These effects were more significant among Asians. In
      addition, an increased ratio of high folate to low vitamin B12 in serum also
      increased the risk of GDM (OR: 1.87; 95% CI: 1.46, 2.41). CONCLUSIONS: In the
      second or third trimester of pregnancy, vitamin B12 deficiency was associated
      with GDM, as well as the ratio of high folate and low vitamin B12 as a risk
      factor for GDM. It is speculated that more vitamin B12 may need to be provided
      during pregnancy. To improve maternal and child health and more comprehensively
      understand the relationship between Vitamin B12 and GDM, more research was needed
      especially the detection of vitamin B12 during the first trimester.

AB  - AIMS: To evaluate whether the Norfolk Quality of Life in Diabetic Neuropathy
      (QOL-DN) questionnaire and the novel Norfolk Mortality Risk Score (NMRS),
      comprising Norfolk QOL-DN items, can identify 4-year mortality risk in
      individuals with diabetes. METHODS: Of 21,756 adults completing Norfolk QOL-DN in
      2012, two groups of surviving and deceased patients were identified in 2016:
      Group 1, from a county capital and Group 2, from six small cities. NMRS was
      calculated in Group 1 using the 2012 scores of Norfolk QOL-DN items that
      discriminate between deceased and surviving participants (p < 0.05) and was
      subsequently applied to Group 2. RESULTS: 763 participants were included (Group
      1: 481 [450 surviving, 31 deceased]; Group 2: 282 [218 surviving, 64 deceased]). 
      Total Norfolk QOL-DN score was significantly higher (worse) in deceased
      participants than in survivors in both groups (p </= 0.008). Optimal cut-off for 
      the 25-item NMRS was 11.5 in Group 1. Individuals in Groups 1 and 2 with NMRS>/= 
      11.5 in 2012 had a 4-year mortality risk ratio of 4.24 (95 % confidence interval 
      [CI]: 1.65-10.84) and 2.33 (95 % CI: 1.33-4.07), respectively, corresponding to 8
      and 16 additional deaths/100 persons/4 years (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Norfolk
      QOL-DN and NMRS can identify individuals with diabetes at risk of 4-year
      mortality.

BTI - IDF DIABETES ATLAS
AB  - The IDF Diabetes Atlas is an authoritative source of evidence on the prevalence
      of diabetes, related morbidity and mortality, as well as diabetes-related health 
      expenditures at global, regional and national levels. The IDF Diabetes Atlas also
      introduces readers to the pathophysiology of diabetes, its classification and its
      diagnostic criteria. It presents the global picture of diabetes for different
      types of diabetes and populations and provides information on specific actions
      that can be taken, such as proven measures to prevent type 2 diabetes and best
      management of all forms of diabetes to avoid subsequent complications. The
      credibility of diabetes estimates relies on the rigorous methods used for the
      selection and analysis of high-quality data sources. For every edition, the IDF
      Diabetes Atlas Committee - composed of thematic experts from each of the seven
      IDF Regions - reviews the methods underlying the IDF Diabetes Atlas estimates and
      projections and available data sources. The majority of the data sources used are
      population-based studies that have been published in peer-reviewed journals. In
      this edition, we have also included data from national diabetes registries. With 
      the establishment of electronic records and national registries becoming more
      common, we anticipate more data like these will be featured in the future.
      Furthermore, information from national health surveys, including some of the
      World Health Organization (WHO) STEPwise approach to Surveillance (STEPS), are
      used where they meet inclusion criteria. Findings of the current 10th edition
      confirm that diabetes is one of the fastest growing global health emergencies of 
      the 21st century. In 2021, it is estimated that 537 million people have diabetes,
      and this number is projected to reach 643 million by 2030, and 783 million by
      2045. In addition, 541 million people are estimated to have impaired glucose
      tolerance in 2021. It is also estimated that over 6.7 million people aged 20-79
      will die from diabetes-related causes in 2021. The number of children and
      adolescents (i.e. up to 19 years old) living with diabetes increases annually. In
      2021, over 1.2 million children and adolescents have type 1 diabetes. Direct
      health expenditures due to diabetes are already close to one trillion USD and
      will exceed this figure by 2030. This IDF Diabetes Atlas 10th edition also shows 
      that hyperglycaemia in pregnancy (HIP) affects approximately one in six
      pregnancies. Another cause for alarm is the consistently high percentage (45%) of
      people with undiagnosed diabetes, which is overwhelmingly type 2. This highlights
      the urgent need to improve the ability to diagnose people with diabetes, many of 
      whom are unaware they have diabetes, and provide appropriate and timely care for 
      all people with diabetes as early as possible.

      effects, and do not cause weight gain or significant hypoglycemia. In fact, they 
      have been found to be effective for weight loss in patients with obesity with and
      without diabetes. They are now the preferred drugs to add to the regimen when
      oral metformin by itself is not enough to meet the patient's hemoglobin A1c goal.

TI  - DNA methylation in gestational diabetes and its predictive value for postpartum
      glucose disturbances.
LID - dgac462 [pii]
LID - 10.1210/clinem/dgac462 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: DNA methylation in the diagnosis of gestational diabetes. OBJECTIVE: To 
      assess the value of DNA methylation in the diagnosis of gestational diabetes
      (GDM) and in the prediction of maternal postpartum glucose disturbances. DESIGN: 
      Two-stage observational between July 2006 and December 2010. SETTING: University 
      Hospital. PATIENTS: Forty-eight randomly selected pregnant women formed the
      discovery cohort (24 with GDM and 24 controls) and 252 pregnant women (94 with
      GDM and 158 controls) formed the replication cohort. GDM women were re-evaluated 
      4 years postpartum. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: GDM, type 2 diabetes or prediabetes at
      4 years postpartum. RESULTS: We identified three CpG sites related to LINC00917, 
      TRAPPC9 and LEF1 that were differentially methylated in women with GDM and
      abnormal glucose tolerance, and the sites associated with LINC00917 and TRAPPC9
      were independently associated with an abnormal glucose tolerance status
      four-years postpartum after controlling for clinical variables. Moreover, the
      site associated with LINC00917 and the combination of the three sites had the
      highest predictive values. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that some of these
      sites may be implicated in the development of GDM and postpartum abnormal glucose
      tolerance.

AB  - Deficits in bone mineral and weaker bone structure in children with type 1
      diabetes (T1D) may contribute to a lifelong risk of fracture. However, there is
      no meta-analysis comparing bone properties beyond density between children with
      T1D and typically developing children (TDC). This meta-analysis aimed to assess
      differences and related factors in bone mineral content (BMC), density, area,
      micro-architecture and estimated strength between children with T1D and TDC. We
      systematically searched MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, Scopus, Cochrane
      Library databases, and included 36 in the meta-analysis (2222 children and youth 
      with T1D, 2316 TDC; mean age </=18yrs., range 1-24). We estimated standardized
      mean differences (SMD) using random-effects models and explored the role of age, 
      body size, sex ratio, disease duration, hemoglobin A1c in relation to BMC and
      areal density (aBMD) SMD using meta-regressions. Children and youth with T1D had 
      lower total body BMC (SMD: -0.21, 95% CI: -0.37 to -0.05), aBMD (-0.30, -0.50 to 
      -0.11); lumbar spine BMC (-0.17, -0.28 to -0.06), aBMD (-0.20, -0.32 to -0.08),
      bone mineral apparent density (-0.30, -0.48 to -0.13); femoral neck aBMD (-0.21, 
      -0.33 to -0.09); distal radius and tibia trabecular density (-0.38, -0.64 to
      -0.12 and -0.35, -0.51 to -0.18, respectively) and bone volume fraction (-0.33,
      -0.56 to -0.09 and -0.37, -0.60 to -0.14, respectively); distal tibia trabecular 
      thickness (-0.41, -0.67 to -0.16); and tibia shaft cortical content (-0.33, -0.56
      to -0.10). Advanced age was associated with larger SMD in total body BMC (-0.13, 
      -0.21 to -0.04) and aBMD (-0.09; -0.17 to -0.01) and longer disease duration with
      larger SMD in total body aBMD (-0.14; -0.24 to -0.04). Children and youth with
      T1D have lower BMC, aBMD and deficits in trabecular density and
      micro-architecture. Deficits in BMC and aBMD appeared to increase with age and
      disease duration. Bone deficits may contribute to fracture risk and require
      attention in diabetes research and care. STUDY REGISTRATION: PROSPERO

      Indian Women.

LID - tpmd211106 [pii]
AB  - Infection of HIV is associated with an increased diabetes risk, which also
      increases tuberculosis risk. It is unknown if similar associations exist with
      gestational diabetes (GDM). We screened pregnant women living with and without
      HIV for GDM using oral glucose tolerance testing. In a subgroup of women with
      latent tuberculosis (positive interferon-gamma [IFN-gamma] release assay), we
      used supernatants from tuberculosis antigen tubes to compare cytokine levels from
      women with and without GDM, matched by age and HIV status. Of 234 women, 21 (9%) 
      had GDM, 13.9% living with HIV, and 6.5% without HIV (P = 0.06). Compared with
      women without GDM, women with GDM had lower median IFN-gamma (19.1 versus 141.9
      pg/mL, P = 0.03) and interleukin-2 (18.7 versus 249 pg/mL, P < 0.01). Our study
      suggests that HIV infection is associated with an increased risk of GDM, which is
      associated with decreased Mycobacterium tuberculosis immune responses.
      Gestational diabetes screening should be prioritized in tuberculosis-endemic
      countries, especially in women living with HIV.

AB  - Type 2 diabetes is associated with an inflammatory phenotype in the pancreatic
      islets. We previously demonstrated that proinflammatory cytokines potently
      activate the tryptophan/kynurenine pathway (TKP) in INS-1 cells and in normal rat
      islets. Here we examined: (1) the TKP enzymes expression in the diabetic GK
      islets; (2) the TKP enzymes expression profiles in the GK islets before and after
      the onset of diabetes; (3) The glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) in
      vitro in GK islets after KMO knockdown using specific morpholino-oligonucleotides
      against KMO or KMO blockade using the specific inhibitor Ro618048; (4) The
      glucose tolerance and GSIS after acute in vivo exposure to Ro618048 in GK rats.
      We report a remarkable induction of the kmo gene in GK islets and in human islets
      exposed to proinflammatory conditions. It occurred prominently in beta cells. The
      increased expression and activity of KMO reflected an acquired adaptation. Both
      KMO knockdown and specific inhibitor Ro618048 enhanced GSIS in vitro in GK
      islets. Moreover, acute administration of Ro618048 in vivo improved glucose
      tolerance, GSIS and basal blood glucose levels in GK rats. These results
      demonstrate that targeting islet TKP is able to correct defective GSIS. KMO
      inhibition could represent a potential therapeutic strategy for type 2 diabetes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: As the disease progresses, many patients with type 2 diabetes have
      difficulty in reaching treatment goals. We aimed to assess the efficacy and
      safety of tirzepatide, a novel GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist, compared with
      dulaglutide in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: This multicentre,
      randomised, double-blind, parallel, active-controlled, phase 3 trial was
      conducted in 46 medical research centres and hospitals in Japan. Adults aged 20
      years or older with type 2 diabetes who had discontinued oral antihyperglycaemic 
      monotherapy or were treatment-naive were included. Participants were randomly
      assigned (1:1:1:1) to receive tirzepatide (5, 10, or 15 mg) or dulaglutide (0.75 
      mg) once per week using a computer-generated random sequence with an Interactive 
      Web Response System. Participants were stratified based on baseline HbA1c
      (</=8.5% or >8.5%), baseline BMI (<25 or >/=25 kg/m(2)), and washout of
      antidiabetic medication. Participants, investigators, and the sponsor were masked
      to treatment assignment. The starting dose of tirzepatide was 2.5 mg once per
      week for 4 weeks, which was then increased to 5 mg in the tirzepatide 5 mg
      treatment group. For the tirzepatide 10 and 15 mg treatment groups, increases by 
      2.5 mg occurred once every 4 weeks until the assigned dose was reached. The
      primary endpoint was mean change in HbA1c from baseline at week 52 measured in
      the modified intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered with
      ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03861052. FINDINGS: Between May 7, 2019, and March 31,
      2021, 821 participants were assessed for study eligibility and 636 were randomly 
      assigned to receive at least one dose of tirzepatide 5 mg (n=159), 10 mg (n=158),
      or 15 mg (n=160), or dulaglutide 0.75 mg (n=159). 615 (97%) participants
      completed the study and 21 (3%) discontinued. Participants had a mean age of 56.6
      years (SD 10.3) and were mostly male (481 [76%]). At week 52, HbA1c decreased
      from baseline by a least squares mean of -2.4 (SE 0.1) for tirzepatide 5 mg, -2.6
      (0.1) for tirzepatide 10 mg, -2.8 (0.1) for tirzepatide 15 mg, and -1.3 (0.1) for
      dulaglutide. Estimated mean treatment differences versus dulaglutide were -1.1
      (95% CI -1.3 to -0.9) for tirzepatide 5 mg, -1.3 (-1.5 to -1.1) for tirzepatide
      10 mg, and -1.5 (-1.71 to -1.4) for tirzepatide 15 mg (all p<0.0001). Tirzepatide
      was associated with dose-dependent reductions in bodyweight with a least square
      mean difference of -5.8 kg (SE 0.4; -7.8% reduction) for 5 mg, -8.5 kg (0.4;
      -11.0% reduction) for 10 mg, and -10.7 kg (0.4; -13.9% reduction) for 15 mg of
      tirzepatide compared with -0.5 kg (0.4; -0.7% reduction) for dulaglutide. The
      most common treatment-emergent adverse events were nausea (19 [12%] participants 
      in the 5 mg group vs 31 [20%] in the 10 mg group vs 32 [20%] in the 15 mg group
      all receiving tirzepatide vs 12 (8%) in the group receiving dulaglutide),
      constipation (24 [15%] vs 28 [18%] vs 22 [14%] vs 17 [11%]), and nasopharyngitis 
      (29 [18%] vs 25 [16%] vs 22 [14%] vs 26 [16%]). The most frequent adverse events 
      were gastrointestinal (23 [4%] of 636). INTERPRETATION: Tirzepatide was superior 
      compared with dulaglutide for glycaemic control and reduction in bodyweight. The 
      safety profile of tirzepatide was consistent with that of GLP-1 receptor
      agonists, indicating a potential therapeutic use in Japanese patients with type 2
      diabetes. FUNDING: Eli Lilly and Company. TRANSLATION: For the Japanese

      medication in patients with type 2 diabetes in Japan (SURPASS J-combo): a
      multicentre, randomised, open-label, parallel-group, phase 3 trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Due to potential ethnic differences in the pathophysiology of type 2 
      diabetes, new therapeutics need to be evaluated in Japanese patients. We aimed to
      assess the safety and glycaemic efficacy of tirzepatide as an add-on treatment in
      Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes who had inadequate glycaemic control with 
      stable doses of various oral antihyperglycaemic monotherapies. METHODS: This
      multicentre, open-label, parallel-group, randomised, phase 3 trial was conducted 
      at 34 medical research centres and hospitals in Japan. Eligible participants were
      aged 20 years or older with inadequately controlled (HbA1c >/=7.0% to <11.0%)
      type 2 diabetes and were receiving oral antihyperglycaemic monotherapy
      (sulfonylureas, biguanides, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, thiazolidinedione,
      glinides, or SGLT2 inhibitors) for at least 3 months (stable dose for >/=8 weeks 
      before screening), had a BMI of 23 kg/m(2) or higher, and stable bodyweight
      (+/-5%) for at least 3 months before screening. After a 2-week screening and
      2-week lead-in period, all participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive
      5, 10, or 15 mg of tirzepatide, administered once per week subcutaneously for 52 
      weeks followed by a 4 week safety follow-up period, using a computer-generated
      random sequence and interactive web response system, stratified by oral
      antihyperglycaemic medication group. All participants started receiving 2.5 mg
      tirzepatide and doses were escalated by 2.5 mg every 4 weeks until the assigned
      dose was reached. The primary endpoint was safety and tolerability during 52
      weeks of treatment, assessed as incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events in
      the modified intention-to-treat (mITT) population. This trial is registered with 
      ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03861039. FINDINGS: Between March 30, 2019, and Feb 16,
      2021, with recruitment and enrolment continuing until Feb 4, 2020, 484
      participants were assessed for eligibility and 443 were randomly assigned to
      receive at least one dose of tirzepatide (148 [33%] in the 5 mg group, 147 [33%] 
      in the 10 mg group, and 148 [33%] in the 15 mg group). 398 (90%) participants
      completed the study and treatment. Most participants (343 [77%] of 443) had at
      least one treatment-emergent adverse event. Treatment-emergent adverse events
      were more frequent in the tirzepatide 15 mg group (125 [84%] of 148) than the 5
      mg (109 [74%] of 148) and 10 mg groups (109 [74%] of 147). The most frequent
      treatment-emergent adverse events with tirzepatide were mild or moderate
      nasopharyngitis (75 [17%]), nausea (74 [17%]), constipation (54 [12%]), diarrhoea
      (51 [12%]), and decreased appetite (44 [10%]). At week 52, mean changes from
      baseline in bodyweight were -3.8 kg (SE 0.5; -5.1% reduction) in the 5 mg group, 
      -7.5 kg (0.5; -10.1% reduction) in the 10 mg group, and -10.2 kg (0.5; -13.2%
      reduction) in the 15 mg group. Least squares mean HbA1c at baseline reduced from 
      8.5% (SE 0.1) to 6.0% (0.1) in the 5 mg tirzepatide group, from 8.6% (0.1) to
      5.6% (0.1) in the 10 mg group, and from 8.6% (0.1) to 5.6% (0.1) in the 15 mg
      group at week 52. No adjudication-confirmed deaths were reported. INTERPRETATION:
      Tirzepatide was well tolerated as an add-on to oral antihyperglycaemic
      monotherapy in Japanese participants with type 2 diabetes and showed improvement 
      in glycaemic control and bodyweight, irrespective of background oral
      antihyperglycaemic medication. Tirzepatide is a potential new treatment option
      for Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes that is inadequately controlled with
      single oral antihyperglycaemic medication. FUNDING: Eli Lilly and Company.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: There may be gender difference in correlation of diabetes mellitus
      (DM) and cardiovascular events. We attempt to investigate whether there is
      gender-heterogeneity in one-year outcomes of atrial fibrillation (AF) patients
      with DM or not. METHODS: Patients who were diagnosed with AF admitted to the
      emergency departments in the Chinese AF Multicenter Registry study were enrolled.
      Basic demographics information, initial Blood Pressure and heart rate, medical
      histories, and treatments of each patient were collected. Follow-up was carried
      out with a mean duration of one year. The primary endpoint was all-cause
      mortality and systemic embolism. RESULTS: A total of 2016 patients were selected 
      from September 2008 and April 2011. All-cause mortality was significantly higher 
      in male AF patients with DM than those without (21.8 % & 13.6 %, P = 0.014). Cox 
      regression analysis showed that there was an interaction between gender and DM
      for one-year all-cause mortality (P = 0.049). DM was significantly associated
      with one-year all-cause mortality regardless of univariate analysis (HR = 1.436, 
      95%CI:1.079-1.911, P = 0.013) or multivariate analysis (HR = 1.418, 95%CI:
      1.059-1.899, P = 0.019). For male patients with AF, DM was significantly
      associated with one-year all-cause mortality (P = 0.048), but not for female
      patients with AF (P = 0.362). CONCLUSION: DM was independently associated with
      one-year all-cause mortality in the entire cohort of AF patients. This
      association was found mainly in male patients with AF, but not in female
      patients. DM management programs may need to reflect gender difference.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relationship between working hours and glycemic
      control. METHODS: Study was performed among Korean participants who underwent at 
      least two health screening exams between 2012 and 2018. The study included 2,169 
      participants who were over 40 years old and undergoing treatment for diabetes at 
      baseline. A hemoglobin A1c level > 9% at the follow-up visit was defined as poor 
      glycemic control. The weekly working hours were divided into three groups for
      analysis. RESULTS: Compared to participants with 45-54 weekly working hours,
      multivariate-adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) for incident poor 
      glycemic control among participants with >/=55 and 35-44 working hours were 1.40 
      (1.01-1.96) and 1.51 (1.09-2.09), respectively. CONCLUSION: Standard working
      hours and long working hours were independent risk factors for poor diabetes
      control in patients with diabetes.

TI  - Early pregnancy body mass index and gestational weight gain: A mediating or
      moderating factor for short stature and risk of gestational diabetes mellitus?
PG  - e0272253
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0272253 [doi]
AB  - This study examined the association between height and the risk of Gestational
      Diabetes Mellitus (GDM), and whether this association was mediated or moderated
      by early pregnancy body mass index (BMI) and gestational weight gain (GWG) that
      are known independent risk factors for GDM. Data of a retrospective cohort of
      pregnant women (N = 1,945) were extracted from antenatal clinic cards. The
      cut-off values of height in relation to risk of GDM were identified using
      receiver operating characteristic analysis and four categories of height were
      derived: < 150 cm, 150-155 cm, 156-160 cm, and > 160cm. Mediation analysis was
      performed using the Preacher and Hayes bootstrapping method while the moderation 
      effect was tested with multiple regression analysis with interaction terms.
      Although there was no mediation effect of BMI and GWG on the association between 
      height and risk of GDM, both factors moderated this association with a
      significant association between shorter height and risk of GDM was observed in
      overweight / obese women (height < 150 cm: AOR = 1.41, 95% CI = 1.03-2.44; height
      156-160 cm: AOR = 1.48, 95% CI = 1.03-2.14). Overweight / obese women with height
      < 150 cm and excessive GWG at the end of the second trimester (AOR = 2.25, 95% CI
      = 1.45-4.17) had significantly higher risk of GDM than those without these
      factors. Short stature (< 150 cm) was significantly associated with GDM risk
      among OW/OB women with excessive gestational weight gain at the end of second
      trimester. This finding underscores the importance of maintaining a healthy BMI
      during reproductive age and gaining weight in recommended range during pregnancy.

TI  - HECTD3 promotes NLRP3 inflammasome and pyroptosis to exacerbate diabetes-related 
      cognitive impairment by stabilising MALT1 to regulate JNK pathway.
PG  - 1-12
LID - 10.1080/13813455.2022.2093377 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: HECTD3 (HECT domain E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 3) exerts biological 
      activities in neuroinflammation of distinct diseases, such as autoimmune
      encephalomyelitis and donations after heart death. However, the effect of HECTD3 
      on diabetes-associated cognitive decline (DACD) remains unclear. METHODS:
      Wild-type or HECTD3-knockout rats were administered with streptozotocin to
      establish diabetic model. Pathological changes in the hippocampus were assessed
      by NISSL and haematoxylin and eosin staining. Morris water maze test was used to 
      assess cognitive function. Neuronal survival and inflammation were investigated
      by immunofluorescence staining and ELISA assay. NLRP3 inflammasome and pyroptosis
      were assessed by western blot, immunofluorescence and flow cytometry assays.
      RESULTS: HECTD3 was up-regulated in hippocampus of streptozotocin-induced
      diabetic rats and high glucose-induced PC12 cells. Knockout of HECTD3 increased
      the number of neurons and improved the learning and memory function. Moreover,
      knockout of HECTD3 promoted in vivo neuronal survival, and reduced levels of
      IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, and IL-6 in the hippocampus. Silencing of HECTD3 increased
      cell viability, and reduced IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, and IL-6 in high glucose-induced
      PC12 cells. Fluorescence intensities of NLRP3, GSDMD-N and caspase-1 were reduced
      in HECTD3-knockout diabetic rats, and knockdown of HECTD3 down-regulated protein 
      expression of NLRP3, GSDMD-N, caspase-1, IL-1beta, and IL-18 in high
      glucose-induced PC12 cells to suppress the pyroptosis. HECTD3 promoted the
      stability of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue 1 (MALT1) through up-regulation of
      c-JUN and phospho (p)-JNK in high glucose-induced PC12 cells. Over-expression of 
      MALT1 attenuated neuroprotective effects of HECTD3 silencing on high
      glucose-induced PC12 cells. CONCLUSION: HECTD3 silencing exerted neuroprotective 
      effect against DACD through MALT1-mediated JNK signalling.HighlightsHECTD3 was

TI  - Sensor-Augmented Insulin Pump with Predictive Low-Glucose Suspend (PLGS):
      Determining Optimal Settings of Pump and Sensor in a Multicenter Cohort of
      Patients with Type 1 Diabetes.
LID - 10.1007/s13300-022-01302-3 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The use of predictive low-glucose suspend (PLGS) sensor-augmented
      pumps has been shown to lead to a significant reduction in hypoglycemic episodes 
      in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D), but their effects on hyperglycemia
      exposure are heterogeneous. The aim of this study was to determine the settings
      of the Medtronic 640G system to obtain the optimal balance between occurrence of 
      both hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia. METHODS: The hypo- and hyperglycemia area
      under the curve (AUC), as well as system settings [hypoglycemic threshold, mean
      insulin total daily dose (TDD), mean basal insulin percentage, and mean daily
      duration of PLGS] were collected between 2 and 12 times during 1 year in patients
      from four university hospital centers. Univariate/multivariate analyses and
      receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves were performed to determine
      factors associated with hyper- and hypoglycemia AUC. RESULTS: A total of 864
      observations were analyzed from 110 patients with T1D. Two preselected settings
      predictive of low hyperglycemia AUC were a basal insulin percentage < 52.0%
      [sensitivity (Se) = 0.66 and specificity (Sp) = 0.53] and a PLGS duration > 157.5
      min/day (Se = 0.47 and Sp = 0.73). The preselected setting predictive of a low
      hypoglycemia AUC was a PLGS duration </= 174.4 min (Se = 0.83 and Sp = 0.51).
      Between-visit variation of PLGS and TDD was positively correlated (r = 0.61; p < 
      0.0001). CONCLUSION: The most important Medtronic 640G setting was the mean daily
      PLGS duration, where a value between 157.5 and 174.4 min/day was associated with 
      the best reduction in both hypo- and hyperglycemia AUC. In this study, we showed 
      that PLGS duration could be indirectly modified through total daily insulin dose 
      adaptation. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study is registered in clinicaltrials.gov
      (NCT03047486).

TI  - Practical Guidance on Open Source and Commercial Automated Insulin Delivery
      Systems: A Guide for Healthcare Professionals Supporting People with
      Insulin-Requiring Diabetes.
LID - 10.1007/s13300-022-01299-9 [doi]
AB  - As increasing numbers of people with insulin-managed diabetes use automated
      insulin delivery (AID) systems or seek such technologies, healthcare providers
      are faced with a steep learning curve. Healthcare providers need to understand
      how to support these technologies to help inform shared decision making,
      discussing available options, implementing them in the clinical setting, and
      guiding users in special situations. At the same time, there is a growing
      diversity of commercial and open source automated insulin delivery systems that
      are evolving at a rapid pace. This practical guide seeks to provide a
      conversational framework for healthcare providers to first understand and then
      jointly assess AID system options with users and caregivers. Using this framework
      will help HCPs in learning how to evaluate potential new commercial or open
      source AID systems, while also providing a guide for conversations to help HCPs
      to assess the readiness and understanding of users for AID systems. The choice of
      an AID system is not as simple as whether the system is open source or
      commercially developed, and indeed there are multiple criteria to assess when
      choosing an AID system. Most importantly, the choices and preferences of the
      person living with diabetes should be at the center of any decision around the
      ideal automated insulin delivery system or any other diabetes technology. This
      framework highlights issues with AID use that may lead to burnout or perceived
      failures or may otherwise cause users to abandon the use of AID. It discusses the
      troubleshooting of basic AID system operation and discusses more advanced topics 
      regarding how to maximize the time spent on AID systems, including how to
      optimize settings and behaviors for the best possible outcomes with AID
      technology for people with insulin-requiring diabetes. This practical approach
      article demonstrates how healthcare providers will benefit from assessing and
      better understanding all available AID system options to enable them to best
      support each individual.

OAB - Automated insulin delivery (AID) systems are a useful tool for people with
      insulin-requiring diabetes. AID systems include an insulin pump, continuous
      glucose monitor (CGM), and an algorithm embedded within the pump or a separate
      mobile device that can determine and automatically adjust insulin delivery in
      response to glucose levels. There are now a number of AID systems available, some
      which are made and distributed by commercial manufacturers and some that are
      available open source. Both open source and commercially developed automated
      insulin delivery systems have been proven to be safe and effective. Open source
      and commercially developed automated insulin delivery systems have also been
      proven to improve the quality of life of people with insulin-requiring diabetes. 
      The choice of an AID system is not merely whether the system is open source or
      commercially developed. There are multiple criteria to assess when choosing an
      AID system: pump, CGM, smartphone connectivity and algorithm capabilities,
      flexibility of the system overall, and interoperability with connected platforms 
      for real-time data access. Most importantly, the choices and preferences of the
      person living with diabetes should be at the center of any decision around the
      ideal automated insulin delivery system or any other diabetes technology.
      Healthcare providers will benefit from assessing and better understanding all
      available AID system options to enable them to best support each individual. This
      practical guide seeks to provide a conversational framework for healthcare
      providers to first understand and then jointly assess AID system options with
      users and caregivers.

TI  - Black New Yorkers with Type 2 Diabetes: Afro-Caribbean Immigrants Have Lower BMI 
      and Lower Waist Circumference than African Americans.
LID - 10.1007/s40615-022-01375-7 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Using the 2013/2014 New York City (NYC) Health and Nutrition
      Examination Survey (NYCHANES) data, this exploratory study examined whether (a)
      type 2 diabetes (diabetes) prevalence differed between NYC Afro-Caribbeans and
      African Americans; (b) anthropometric, biochemical, and sociodemographic diabetes
      profiles differed between and within groups; and (c) diabetes odds differed
      between and within groups. METHODS: Diabetes was defined as prior diagnosis,
      HbA1c >/= 6.5% (7.8 mmol/L), or fasting glucose >/= 126 mg/dL. Weighted logistic 
      regression estimated diabetes odds by nativity and either waist circumference
      (WC) (cm) or BMI (kg/m(2)). All regression models controlled for age,
      hypertension, gender, education, income, marital status, physical activity, and
      smoking. RESULTS: Among Afro-Caribbeans (n = 81, 65% female, age (mean +/- SE) 49
      +/- 2 years, BMI 29.2 +/- 0.7 kg/m(2)) and African Americans (n = 118, 50%
      female, age 47 +/- 2 years, BMI 30.3 +/- 0.9 kg/m(2)), Afro-Caribbeans with
      diabetes had lower BMI (29.9 +/- 0.8 kg/m(2) vs. 34.6 +/- 1.7 kg/m(2), P = 0.01) 
      and lower WC (102 +/- 2 cm vs. 114 +/- 3 cm, P = 0.002) than African Americans
      with diabetes. Afro-Caribbeans with diabetes had lower prevalence of obesity
      (33.2% vs. 74.7%) and higher prevalence of overweight (57.2% vs. 13.5%) (P =
      0.02) than African Americans with diabetes. Odds of diabetes did not differ
      between Afro-Caribbeans and African Americans. In models predicting the effect of
      WC, diabetes odds increased with WC (OR = 1.07 (95% CI 1.02, 1.11), P = 0.003)
      and age (OR = 1.09 (95% CI 1.03-1.15), P = 0.003) for African Americans only. In 
      models predicting the effect of BMI, diabetes odds increased for Afro-Caribbeans 
      with age (OR = 1.06 (1.01, 1.11)*, P = 0.04) and hypertension (OR = 5.62 (95% CI 
      1.04, 30.42), P = 0.045), whereas for African Americans, only age predicted
      higher diabetes odds (OR = 1.08 (95% CI 1.03, 1.14), P = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: In 
      NYC, Afro-Caribbeans with diabetes have lower BMI and lower WC than African
      Americans with diabetes, but odds of diabetes do not differ. Combining
      African-descent populations into one group obscures clinical differences and
      generalizes diabetes risk.

TI  - Periodontitis and implant complications in diabetes.
LID - 10.1111/prd.12451 [doi]
AB  - Epidemiologic evidence indicates that periodontitis is more frequent in patients 
      with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus than in healthy controls, suggesting that it 
      could be considered the "sixth complication" of diabetes. Actually, diabetes
      mellitus and periodontitis are two extraordinarily prevalent chronic diseases
      that share a number of comorbidities all converging toward an increased risk of
      cardiovascular disease. Periodontal treatment has recently been shown to have the
      potential to improve the metabolic control of diabetes, although long-term
      studies are lacking. Uncontrolled diabetes also seems to affect the response to
      periodontal treatment, as well as the risk to develop peri-implant diseases.
      Mechanisms of associations between diabetes mellitus and periodontal disease
      include the release of advanced glycation end products as a result of
      hyperglycemia and a range of shared predisposing factors of genetic, microbial,
      and lifestyle nature. This review discusses the evidence for the risk of
      periodontal and peri-implant disease in diabetic patients and the potential role 
      of the dental professional in the diabetes-periodontal interface.

TI  - Effect of 1% malic acid spray on diabetes mellitus induced xerostomia: A
      randomized clinical trial.
LID - 10.1111/odi.14327 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Evaluating the effectiveness of topical sialogogue spray containing 1%
      malic acid in treatment of xerostomia in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. 
      MATERIAL AND METHODS: A randomized double-blind controlled clinical trial was
      conducted on 52 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus suffering from xerostomia.
      Patients were assigned equally into test group who received a topical sialogogue 
      spray containing 1% malic acid and control group who received a placebo spray.
      Both groups were instructed to use the spray on demand for 2 weeks. The Summated 
      Xerostomia Inventory-Dutch Version questionnaire (SXI-D) and the unstimulated
      salivary flow rate were evaluated for all patients at baseline, 2 and 4 weeks
      after malic acid/placebo application. RESULTS: At 2 week's follow-up the
      unstimulated salivary flow rate increased significantly from 0.059 +/- 0.024 to
      0.191 +/- 0.064 and from 0.055 +/- 0.026 to 0.078 +/- 0.032 for test and control 
      groups respectively with a statistically significant difference favoring the test
      group. (SXI-D) scores showed a significant decrease from 10.73 +/- 2.22 to 8.38
      +/- 2.28 in the test group (p<0.05), while in the control group it decreased from
      10.62 +/- 1.75 to 10.23 +/- 1.48 (p >0.05). CONCLUSION: A sialogogue spray
      containing 1% malic acid increased the unstimulated salivary flow rate in
      patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus suffering from xerostomia.

TI  - Association and Familial Coaggregation of Childhood-Onset Type 1 Diabetes With
      Depression, Anxiety, and Stress-Related Disorders: A Population-Based Cohort
      Study.
LID - dc211347 [pii]
LID - 10.2337/dc21-1347 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To estimate the association and familial coaggregation of
      childhood-onset type 1 diabetes with depression, anxiety, and stress-related
      disorders. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a population-based cohort study 
      with use of data from Swedish nationwide registers. A total of approximately 3.5 
      million individuals born in Sweden 1973-2007 were linked to their biological
      parents, full siblings and half-siblings, and cousins. Cox models were used to
      estimate the association and familial coaggregation of type 1 diabetes with
      depression, anxiety, and stress-related disorders. RESULTS: Individuals diagnosed
      with childhood-onset type 1 diabetes (n = 20,005) were found to be at greater
      risks of all outcomes: any psychiatric diagnosis (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]
      1.66 [95% CI 1.59-1.72]) or specific diagnoses of depression (1.85 [1.76-1.94]), 
      anxiety (1.41[1.33-1.50]), and stress-related disorders (1.75 [1.62-1.89]), as
      well as use of antidepressants or anxiolytics (1.30 [1.26-1.34]), compared with
      individuals without type 1 diabetes. Overall, relatives of individuals with type 
      1 diabetes were at elevated risks of developing these outcomes, with the highest 
      risks seen in parents (aHRs 1.18-1.25), followed by full siblings (aHRs
      1.05-1.20), and the magnitudes of risk estimates appear proportional to familial 
      relatedness. CONCLUSIONS: These results support existing evidence that children
      and adolescents with type 1 diabetes are at greater risks of developing
      depression, anxiety, and stress-related disorders and indicate that shared
      familial factors might contribute to these elevated risks. Our findings highlight
      the need for psychological consulting for children and their families in diabetes
      care. Quantitative and molecular genetic studies are warranted to further
      understand the etiology of these psychiatric disorders in type 1 diabetes.

PG  - 10600280221115816
LID - 10.1177/10600280221115816 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: While statins (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase
      inhibitors) reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, there is controversy
      regarding a potentially causal link with incident diabetes mellitus (DM). This
      association may partially be due to confounding by indication; since prescription
      guidelines encourage statin use among those diagnosed with DM, this may encourage
      their prescription among those with elevated blood glucose in the absence of DM
      diagnosis. OBJECTIVE: The study examined the association between low-density
      lipoprotein (LDL) reduction following initiation of statin use and new-onset DM
      among veterans. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using data
      from the James A. Haley Veteran's Hospital in Tampa, Florida. Patients with a
      visit between January 2007 and December 2011 were selected from the Veterans
      Information Systems and Technology Architecture system. Individuals were
      classified into categories of statin usage based on LDL reduction percentages and
      frequency-matched with controls. The primary outcome of interest was incident DM.
      RESULTS: There was a significant association between LDL reduction and DM which
      was higher in lower LDL reduction groups (low response hazard ratio [HR]: 2.12,
      95% CI: 1.62, 2.79; moderate response HR: 1.85, 95% CI: 1.40, 2.45; high response
      HR: 1.24, 95% CI: 0.74, 2.07). CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: This association may
      partially be explained by potential lifestyle modifications individuals may make 
      when prescribed a statin which may reduce their risk of DM independent of the
      statin usage. This research has demonstrated a protective association between
      greater LDL reduction and DM at the individual level while reenforcing the
      evidence of an association between statin usage and DM.

TI  - Impact of SGLT2 inhibitors on the kidney in people with type 2 diabetes and
      severely increased albuminuria.
LID - 10.1080/17512433.2022.2108402 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Diabetes is the most common cause of end stage kidney disease.
      Therapies such as sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors have been identified
      over the last decade as effective oral hypoglycemic agents that also confer
      additional cardio and kidney protection. Knowledge of their mechanism of action
      and impact on patients with diabetes and albuminuria is vital in galvanizing
      prescriber confidence and increasing clinical uptake. AREAS COVERED: This
      manuscript discusses the pathophysiology of diabetic kidney disease,
      patho-physiological mechanisms for sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors,
      and their impact on patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus and albuminuric kidney
      disease. EXPERT OPINION: Sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors reduce
      albuminuria with consequent benefits on cardiovascular and kidney outcomes in
      patients with diabetes and severe albuminuria. Whilst they have been incorporated
      into guidelines, the uptake of these agents into clinical practice has been slow.
      Increasing the uptake of these agents into clinical practice is necessary to
      improve outcomes for the large number of patients with diabetic kidney disease
      globally.

OAB - PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: People with type 2 diabetes and severe urinary protein
      loss are at high risk of progression to kidney failure requiring dialysis or
      transplantation. Preventing or slowing down loss of kidney function is crucial to
      preventing kidney failure. This review will discuss how diabetic kidney disease
      occurs, how a new family of glucose lowering agents, the sodium-glucose
      co-transporter-2 inhibitors, work and how they affect people with Type 2 diabetes
      mellitus who also have protein leaking from their kidneys. It will also detail
      the current data that underpins the guideline recommendations for use of these
      agents in the management of patients with and without diabetes.

PG  - 1-33
LID - 10.1017/S0007114522002422 [doi]
AB  - We aimed to examine the association between the quantity and quality of dietary
      fat in early pregnancy and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) risk. 1477
      singleton pregnancy women were included from Sichuan Provincial Hospital for
      Women and Children, Southwest China. Dietary information was collected by a 3-d
      24-h dietary recall. GDM was diagnosed based on the results of a 75-g, 2-h oral
      glucose tolerance test at 24-28 gestational weeks. Log-binomial models were used 
      to estimate relative risks (RR) and 95% CI. The results showed that total fat
      intake was positively associated with GDM risk (Q4 v. Q1: RR=1.40; 95 % CI: 1.11,
      1.76; Ptrend= 0.001). This association was also observed for the intakes of
      animal fat and vegetable fat. After stratified by total fat intake (<30%E v.
      >/=30%E), the higher animal fat intake was associated with higher GDM risk in the
      high-fat group but the moderate animal fat intake was associated with reduced
      risk of GDM (T2 v. T1: RR= 0.65; 95 % CI: 0.45, 0.96) in the normal-fat group.
      Vegetable fat intake was positively associated with GDM risk in the high-fat
      group but not in the normal-fat group. No association between fatty acids intakes
      and GDM risk were found. In conclusion, total fat, animal and vegetable fat
      intakes were positively associated with GDM risk, respectively. Whereas, when
      total fat intake was not excessive, higher intakes of animal and vegetable fat
      were likely irrelevant with increased GDM risk, even the moderate animal fat
      intake could be linked to lower GDM risk.

TI  - The role of selected nutraceuticals in management of prediabetes and diabetes: An
      updated review of the literature.
LID - 10.1002/ptr.7564 [doi]
AB  - Dysglycemia is a disease state preceding the onset of diabetes and includes
      impaired fasting glycemia and impaired glucose tolerance. This review aimed to
      collect and analyze the literature reporting the results of clinical trials
      evaluating the effects of selected nutraceuticals on glycemia in humans. The
      results of the analyzed trials, generally, showed the positive effects of the
      nutraceuticals studied alone or in association with other supplements on fasting 
      plasma glucose and post-prandial plasma glucose as primary outcomes, and their
      efficacy in improving insulin resistance as a secondary outcome. Some evidences, 
      obtained from clinical trials, suggest a role for some nutraceuticals, and in
      particular Berberis, Banaba, Curcumin, and Guar gum, in the management of
      prediabetes and diabetes. However, contradictory results were found on the
      hypoglycemic effects of Morus, Ilex paraguariensis, Omega-3, Allium cepa, and
      Trigonella faenum graecum, whereby rigorous long-term clinical trials are needed 
      to confirm these data. More studies are also needed for Eugenia jambolana, as
      well as for Ascophyllum nodosum and Fucus vesiculosus which glucose-lowering
      effects were observed when administered in combination, but not alone. Further
      trials are also needed for quercetin.

TI  - Prevalence and incidence of mental health issues amongst adults with diabetes at 
      risk of foot complications in the European Union: a systematic review protocol.
LID - 10.11124/JBIES-21-00372 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this systematic review is to evaluate and synthesize 
      the evidence to establish the prevalence and incidence of mental health issues in
      people at risk of diabetic foot ulceration, living within the European Union.
      INTRODUCTION: Due to the large health and financial burden of diabetic foot
      ulceration, prevention is a key focus for clinicians and researchers. Current
      foot ulcer prevention strategies are directed at the assessment and management of
      physical pathologies and risk factors for diabetic foot ulceration. Psychological
      burden and risk factors are often overlooked. This review will determine the
      prevalence and incidence of mental health issues among adults with diabetes
      mellitus, who are at risk of foot ulceration. The review will focus on European
      Union countries. INCLUSION CRITERIA: Studies considered for inclusion will report
      on adults with a formal diagnosis of either type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus,
      who are at risk of foot ulceration and mental health issues. Studies will have
      been completed in the European Union. METHODS: A search of MEDLINE, CINAHL, AMED,
      Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL, and PsycINFO will be conducted for studies published or
      translatable into English. Unpublished and gray literature will be searched.
      Studies will be selected against the review inclusion/exclusion criteria, and
      selected studies will be critically appraised, with data extraction and synthesis
      completed using the relevant JBI systematic review tools. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW

TI  - Clinical Efficacy of Retroauricular Injection of Methylprednisolone Sodium
      Succinate in the Treatment of Sudden Deafness with Type 2 Diabetes.
PG  - 3097436
LID - 10.1155/2022/3097436 [doi]
AB  - Background: The etiology of sudden deafness is still unclear. In recent years,
      people's life rhythm is getting faster and faster. Fatigue, environment, diet,
      psychology, and other factors have increased the morbidity rate of sudden
      deafness and improved the quality of life of patients. And work efficiency is
      greatly affected. Aims: A study to investigate the clinical efficacy of
      postauricular injection of methylprednisolone sodium succinate in the treatment
      of sudden deafness with type 2 diabetes. Materials and Methods: Sixty patients
      with sudden deafness who were treated in our hospital from January 2018 to
      October 2020 were selected as the subjects of this prospective study and divided 
      into 30 cases each in the comparison group and the observation group according to
      the random number remainder grouping method. The comparison group was treated
      conventionally, and the observation group was treated with postauricular
      injection of methylprednisolone sodium succinate on the basis of the comparison
      group. Patients in the two groups were observed and compared on the 3rd, 6th, and
      9th days after treatment with pure-tone hearing threshold checks and regular
      monitoring of blood glucose, blood rheology, and other indexes. Results: On the
      7th, 14th, and 30th days after treatment, the pure-tone audiometric thresholds of
      the two groups were gradually decreased, and the changes in the pure-tone
      audiometric thresholds in the observation group were greater than those in the
      control group. After lunch on the 6th day and after lunch on the 9th day, it was 
      lower than that in the control group, and the difference was statistically
      significant (P < 0.05). 30 days after treatment, the blood viscosity, fibrin, and
      platelet aggregation rate of the observation group were significantly lower than 
      those of the control group. After treatment, the clinical efficacy rate of the
      observation group was 96%, which was significantly higher than that of the
      control group, 80%, and the above differences were statistically significant (P <
      0.05). Conclusion: Treatment with postauricular injection of methylprednisolone
      sodium succinate has shown better therapeutic recovery in patients with sudden
      deafness, improved pure-tone hearing threshold, reduced risk of blood glucose
      elevation, and improved clinical outcomes for patients with sudden deafness,
      providing some reference for the treatment of patients with sudden deafness.

TI  - The Level of HbA1c Evaluates the Extent of Coronary Atherosclerosis Lesions and
      the Prognosis in Diabetes with Acute Coronary Syndrome.
PG  - 7796809
LID - 10.1155/2022/7796809 [doi]
AB  - Background: The level of HbA1c can reflect the average level of blood glucose
      over 3 months, which is the gold standard indicator for monitoring blood glucose.
      The relationship between the level of HbA1c and the extent of coronary
      atherosclerosis lesions or the prognosis in diabetes with acute coronary syndrome
      (ACS) remains poorly understood. Aims: To explore whether the level of HbA1c can 
      evaluate the extent of coronary atherosclerosis lesions or the prognosis in
      diabetes with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) using the SYNTAX score, the Global
      Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) score, left ventricular function
      (LVEF), left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV), and major adverse cardiac 
      events (MACEs) in the hospital and 12 months after discharge. Methods: This study
      was a prospective, randomized, open-label, and parallel group study. Patients
      with diabetes with ACS were recruited into this study indiscriminately, and all
      the participants were divided into two groups according to the level of HbA1c:
      HbA1c level </= 7%group and HbA1c level > 7%group. The followings were used as
      the evaluation indicators: SYNTAX score, GRACE score, LVEF, LVEDV, and MACEs in
      hospital and 12 months after discharge. Results: A total of 233 patients with
      diabetes and ACS were enrolled and assigned to two groups according to their
      level of HbA1c: the HbA1c </= 7%group (n = 92) and the HbA1c > 7%group (n = 141).
      The results showed that the proportion of STEMI was higher in the HbA1c </=7%
      group (p < 0.05), while the proportion of NSTEMI has not significantly higher in 
      the HbA1c >7% group (p > 0.05). Regression analysis indicated that HbA1c level
      was significantly positively correlated with GRACE score (r = 0.156, F = 5.784, p
      = 0.017, n = 233) and SYNTAX score (r = 0.237, F = 13.788, p < 0.001, n = 233),
      and there were no statistically significant differences in LVEDV and LVEF between
      the two groups (p > 0.05). The total MACEs rate showed no significant difference 
      between the two groups during hospitalization (p > 0.05) but showed significant
      differences at 12 months after discharge (p < 0.05). Conclusions: This study
      shows that HbA1c level was positively correlated with the extent of coronary
      atherosclerosis lesions and the prognosis in diabetes with ACS. The higher the
      HbA1c level is, the more severe the coronary atherosclerotic lesion and the worse
      the prognosis in diabetes with ACS are.

AB  - Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the major complications of diabetic eye
      diseases, causing vision loss and blindness worldwide. The concept of diabetic
      retinopathy has evolved from microvascular disease into more complex
      neurovascular disorders. Early in the disease progression of diabetes, the
      neuronal and glial cells are compromised before any microvascular abnormalities
      clinically detected by the ophthalmoscopic examination. This implies
      understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms at the early stage of disease
      progression especially due to diabetes-induced metabolic alterations to damage
      the neural retina so that early intervention and treatments options can be
      identified to prevent and inhibit the progression of DR. Hyperglycemia has been
      widely considered the major contributor to the progression of the retinal damage,
      even though tight control of glucose does not seem to have a bigger effect on the
      incidence or progression of retinal damage that leads to DR. Emerging evidence
      suggests that besides diabetes-induced hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia and amino acid
      defects might be a major contributor to the progression of early neurovascular
      retinal damage. In this review, we have discussed recent advances in the
      alterations of key metabolites of carbohydrate, lipid, and amino acids and their 
      implications for neurovascular damage in DR.

AB  - Background and Purpose: According to reports, type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a
      progressive disease. However, no known research has examined the progressive
      brain structural changes associated with T2D. The purpose of this study was to
      determine whether T2D patients exhibit progressive brain structural alterations
      and, if so, how the alterations progress. Materials and Methods: Structural
      magnetic resonance imaging scans were collected for 81 T2D patients and 48
      sex-and age-matched healthy controls (HCs). Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and
      causal structural covariance network (CaSCN) analyses were applied to investigate
      gray matter volume (GMV) alterations and the likely chronological processes
      underlying them in T2D. Two sample t-tests were performed to compare group
      differences, and the differences were corrected using Gaussian random field (GRF)
      correction (voxel-level p < 0.001, cluster-level p < 0.01). Results: Our findings
      demonstrated that GMV alterations progressed in T2D patients as disease duration 
      increased. In the early stages of the disease, the right temporal pole of T2D
      patients had GMV atrophy. As the diseases duration prolonged, the limbic system, 
      cerebellum, subcortical structures, parietal cortex, frontal cortex, and
      occipital cortex progressively exhibited GMV alterations. The patients also
      exhibited a GMV alterations sequence exerting from the right temporal pole to the
      limbic-cerebellum-striatal-cortical network areas. Conclusion: Our results
      indicate that the progressive GMV alterations of T2D patients manifested a
      limbic-cerebellum-striatal-cortical sequence. These findings may contribute to a 
      better understanding of the progression and an improvement of current diagnosis
      and intervention strategies for T2D.

AB  - Aim: To explore the clinical outcomes among preadmission insulin-treated type 2
      diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in intensive care units (ICU). Patients and Methods: In 
      this retrospective observational study, 578 T2DM patients admitted to ICU were
      recruited from March 2011 to February 2021, which were composed of 528 patients
      treated with insulin after ICU admission (including 300 preadmission
      non-insulin-treated and 228 preadmission insulin-treated patients) and 50
      patients treated without insulin before and after ICU admission. Clinical
      outcomes were compared between the groups. Variables of age (+/- 10 years),
      gender, blood glucose >10 mmol/l on ICU admission, and original comorbidities
      were used for matching to get the 1:1 matched cohort. The Kaplan-Meier survival
      curves were graphed to describe the survival trend and Cox regression analysis
      was performed to get adjusted hazard ratio (HR). Results: Compared with the
      preadmission non-insulin-treated T2DM patients, preadmission insulin-treated T2DM
      patients had higher incidence of hypoglycemia [14.5% (33/228) vs 8.7% (26/300); p
      = 0.036]. In the 1:1 matched cohort, the preadmission insulin-treated T2DM
      patients had significantly increased mortality rate [30.0% (45/150) vs (16.0%
      (24/150)); adjusted HR, 1.68 (1.01-2.80)] than preadmission non-insulin-treated
      T2DM patients. Compared with T2DM patients treated without insulin before and
      after ICU admission, preadmission insulin-treated T2DM patients had higher
      mortality and longer length of ICU stay (all p < 0.05). Conclusion: Preadmission 
      insulin treatment was associated with increased mortality rate and longer length 
      of ICU stay among T2DM patients in ICU. Preadmission insulin-treated T2DM
      patients might have worse clinical outcomes when they are critically ill.

AB  - Introduction: Early detection of bacterial infections associated with adequate
      antibiotic treatment is key to improving diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) outcomes.
      Our study aimed to investigate the different sepsis markers (including
      procalcitonin to lactic acid ratio, PLR) to diagnose bacterial infection in
      patients with DKA within one hour after admission. Methods: A total of 165
      patients diagnosed with DKA were enrolled between July 2014 and July 2018 and
      divided into an infection group (N =62) and a non-infection group (N=103) based
      on the positive aetiological tests such as blood culture, sputum culture, urine
      culture, or definite focus of pulmonary, soft tissue, kidney, etc. Results: Our
      findings suggest the following: 1) leucocytes (threshold above 10x10(9) /L) and
      PLR (threshold above 0.438) within one hour after admission can help to identify 
      patients with infection in the context of DKA. 2) A subgroup analysis
      demonstrated that PLR also has a high diagnostic efficacy for infection in
      patients with DKA, regardless of the type of diabetes. Conclusion: This study
      concludes that leucocyte count (threshold > 10x10(9)/L) and PLR (threshold above 
      0.438) show a diagnostic value to help distinguish DKA patients with infection.
      By combining these two markers, the reduction of antibiotic misuse may be
      possible.

AB  - Objective: To analyze the associations between serum albumin (sALB) level and
      diabetic microvascular complications, including diabetic retinopathy (DR) and
      diabetic kidney disease (DKD), in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). 
      Methods: This retrospective study included 951 hospitalized patients with T2DM
      who had completed screening for DR and DKD during hospitalization. Patients were 
      divided into three groups according to sALB tertiles. Multivariate logistic
      regression analysis was used to assess the association of sALB with microvascular
      complications. Results: The prevalence of DR, DKD and macroalbuminuria increased 
      with decreasing sALB levels. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed
      that lower levels of sALB (Q1) were associated with higher risk of DR (odds ratio
      [OR]: 1.59, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.12-2.26), DKD (OR: 3.00, 95% CI:
      2.04-4.41) and macroalbuminuria (OR: 9.76, 95% CI: 4.62-20.63) compared with
      higher levels of sALB (Q3) after adjustment for other risk factors. After
      stratification by sex and age, the effect of lower levels of sALB (Q1) on DR
      incidence was more obvious in patients with male (OR: 1.60, 95% CI: 1.00-2.56),
      and aged<65 years (OR: 1.74, 95% CI: 1.14-2.65) (P < 0.05 for all); the effect of
      lower levels of sALB (Q1) on the incidence of DKD was significant in both males
      (OR: 3.78, 95% CI: 2.26-6.32) and females (OR: 2.35, 95% CI: 1.26-4.35) (P < 0.05
      for all), while only the age <65 years (OR: 3.46, 95% CI: 2.16-5.53) was
      significant in the age subgroup (P < 0.001). Conclusion: Decreased sALB levels
      may be an independent risk indicator of DR and DKD in patients with T2DM, and
      significantly associated with DKD progression. For DR screening, special
      attention should be paid to men aged <65 years, while screening for DKD should
      pay attention to people <65 years old.

      conduct systematic review of any types of complementary and alternative medicine 
      for glycemic control of diabetes mellitus. Four databases was used in this study,
      the CINAHL, PUBMED, SCOPUS, and ProQUEST. The systematic review were reported
      according to the PRISMA guidelines. The keywords were used according to medical
      subject headings (MeSH) in this study were diabetes mellitus AND complementary
      and alternative medicine AND blood glucose levels or blood sugar or blood
      glucose. Articles were limited to 2015-2021 and only in English language. We
      obtained 231 articles from these databases: CINAHL six articles, PUBMED 85
      articles, SCOPUS 66 articles, PROQUEST 74 articles. Then, the final results
      recorded 17 articles. The results of a systematic review showed the effectiveness
      of natural products as CAM for glycemic control of DM, namely Berberis
      aristata/Silybum marianum, fenugreek seed, bitter melon, cinnamon or whortleberry
      supplements, a combination of herbal plants (C. spinosa, R. canina, and S.
      securigera), Nigella sativa, Mulberry juice, chicory, chamomile tea, and bell
      pepper juice combined with an integrated approach of yoga therapy. Mind body
      practices such as auditory guided imagery (AGI), qigong and tai chi exercises,
      and relaxation. Whole system approach, such as acupressure. Health care providers
      consider CAM for DM management.

      Systematic Review and Important Emerging Themes.
PG  - e26325
LID - 10.7759/cureus.26325 [doi]
AB  - Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), obstructive
      sleep apnea (OSA), and obesity represent four large and growing patient
      populations. A great deal of scientific and clinical knowledge has been developed
      for them individually, and significant advancements made. Taken as a group,
      however, the interrelationships are not as well understood. The purpose of this
      systematic review is to identify the body of existing research that ties them
      together and then to identify and discuss the prevailing themes, particularly for
      cause-and-effect mechanisms. PubMed, Google Scholar, and ScienceDirect were used 
      to identify systematic reviews and meta-analysis articles to establish the
      broadest reach. Initially, 434 articles were carefully screened, out of which 22 
      most relevant studies were reviewed. Five important themes were distilled from
      these papers based on continued and consistent emphasis in the literature. These 
      themes include topics such as the importance of considering visceral obesity
      rather than Body Mass Index (BMI), the most effective treatment approaches,
      including mounting support for melatonin and circadian rhythm management, the
      results of OSA in its feed-forward contribution to hormone imbalance, the role of
      non-obesity-related risk factors to PCOS and OSA such as age and genetic
      predisposition, and growing evidence to suggest the importance of mental health
      as a comorbidity in addition to the more traditional ones such as cardiovascular 
      pathology. A new framework for investigating the interaction across these four
      disorders is offered that includes a revised perspective on the specific role of 
      PCOS, perhaps being further upstream relative to the others. There currently
      exists a lack of well-designed randomized controlled trials in this particular
      area of medicine, an endeavor we believe could result in significant value,
      particularly as it relates to treatment approaches.

TI  - Clinical Application of Traditional Chinese Medicine Therapy for Type 2 Diabetes 
      Mellitus: An Evidence Map.
PG  - 2755332
LID - 10.1155/2022/2755332 [doi]
AB  - Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), a common disease with a complex etiology in the 
      world, is an important risk factor for severe cardiovascular and cerebrovascular 
      diseases. However, treatments of T2DM are mainly based on Western medicine, whose
      severe side effects make traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) therapy more
      appealing to patients and clinicians. The overall clinical evidence for different
      TCM therapies in the treatment of T2DM is still unclear. This study aimed to
      adopt the evidence-mapping method and integrate the evidence from various
      researches on this topic, to depict the whole picture of TCM therapies for T2DM. 
      This review included searches of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and three major 
      Chinese literature databases (CNKI, VIP, and Wanfang) from inception to November 
      18, 2021. Two independent reviewers screened the literature, extracted
      information, and evaluated the quality of all included studies. A systematic
      review was subsequently performed. In total, 47 studies were reviewed, of which
      46 studies (97.9%) were from China and 1 (2.1%) was from Canada. The evidence map
      was conducted according to different TCM therapies, including herbs or herbal
      extracts, compounds, powders, decoctions, pills, external treatment, basic
      theories and treatment principles of TCM, proprietary Chinese medicines, and
      unspecified TCM integrated therapies. According to the AMSTAR-2 scoring results, 
      4 papers were rated as high quality, 11 were low quality, and 32 were very low
      quality. Outcome indicators mainly focused on FBG, HbA1c, 2-h PBG, TC, TG, LDL-C,
      etc. The results showed that different types of TCM treatment had different
      improvement effects on the outcome indicators of T2DM. More consistent benefits
      were observed in the improvement of FBG, HbA1c, and 2-h PBG with treatment
      regimens based on basic theories and treatment principles of TCM, decoctions and 
      pills, and unspecified TCM integrated therapies. Among herbs, ginger and Coptis
      root showed more improvement in all outcomes. Compounds, powders, and external
      treatment showed relatively consistent beneficial effects on the improvement of
      FBG. No serious adverse events were reported. Overall, the current evidence map
      provided an intuitive overview of the beneficial effects of TCM therapies in the 
      treatment of type 2 diabetes. This study can be used as a reference for the
      clinical application of traditional Chinese medicine in T2DM, but due to the
      low-quality level of the included studies, it should be treated with caution in
      clinical practices.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the clinical changes of TCM syndrome type and
      microalbuminuria in patients with hypertension and diabetes mellitus. Methods: A 
      total of 442 patients with hypertension and diabetes who were admitted to our
      hospital from June 2016 to June 2021 were selected. All patients were divided
      into medication group and control group according to the random number method.
      Patients in the medication group were treated with conventional Western
      medicine-assisted traditional Chinese medicine, while patients in the control
      group were not treated with adjuvant medicine. The blood pressure and blood
      glucose of patients in the two groups were controlled within the normal range,
      and the clinical effects of the two groups were observed. Results: The treatment 
      of hypertension and diabetes in the two groups was diagnosed by the TCM syndrome 
      type, and the cure rate was higher in the medication group. After 3 months, the
      glomerular filtration rate in the medication group increased steadily and the
      renal artery resistance index decreased, while the indexes in the control group
      had no significant change, with statistical significance (P < 0.05). After 6
      months, the urinary albumin excretion rate and the ratio of urinary albumin to
      creatinine in the medication group were significantly decreased compared with
      those before medication, while there were no significant changes in the control
      group, with statistical significance (P < 0.05). The urine excretion rate of
      albumin in hypertensive patients with diabetes is higher, leading to the
      increased probability of microalbuminuria in patients, which is not only related 
      to the course of hypertension and diabetes but also positively related to the
      course of hypertension and diabetes, smoking, drinking, and diet. Conclusion: The
      combination of the TCM syndrome type and Western medicine detection method is
      more conducive to the two diagnosis and treatment methods that complement each
      other, improve each other, improve the effect of diagnosis and treatment, and are
      worthy of further research by researchers, so as to promote clinical application.
      Some other bad habits should also be corrected, such as smoking, drinking, and
      irregular diet, through adjusting the diet; control of high protein intake is
      also an important intervention measure for disease.

TI  - The Association of Salt Intake and Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease in People
      With Type 2 Diabetes: A Cross-Sectional Study.
PG  - 943790
LID - 10.3389/fnut.2022.943790 [doi]
AB  - Objectives: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which has a close
      relationship with type 2 diabetes (T2D), is related to salt intake in the general
      population. In contrast, the relationship between salt intake and the presence of
      NAFLD in patients with T2D has not been clarified. Methods: Salt intake (g/day)
      was assessed using urinary sodium excretion, and a high salt intake was defined
      as an intake greater than the median amount of 9.5 g/day. Hepatic steatosis index
      (HSI) >/= 36 points was used to diagnosed NAFLD. Odds ratios of high salt intake 
      to the presence of NAFLD were evaluated by logistic regression analysis. Results:
      The frequency of NAFLD was 36.5% in 310 patients with T2D (66.7 +/- 10.7 years
      old and 148 men). The patients with high salt intake had a higher body mass index
      (25.0 +/- 4.0 vs. 23.4 +/- 3.8 kg/m(2), p < 0.001) than those with low salt
      intake. HSI in patients with high salt intake was higher than that in patients
      with low salt intake (36.2 +/- 6.2 vs. 34.3 +/- 5.5 points, p = 0.005). In
      addition, the presence of NALFD in patients with high salt intake was higher than
      that in patients with low salt intake (44.5% vs. 28.4%, p = 0.005). High salt
      intake was associated with the prevalence of NAFLD [adjusted odds ratio, 1.76
      (95% confidence interval: 1.02-3.03), p = 0.043]. Conclusion: This
      cross-sectional study revealed that salt intake is related to the prevalence of
      NAFLD in patients with T2D.

AB  - Background: Our study aimed to investigate the association between iron
      metabolism and body composition in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
      Methods: A total of 824 patients with T2DM were enrolled. Measurements of body
      composition were obtained by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Patients were
      stratified into three groups according to their sex-specific ferritin levels.
      Basic information, laboratory results, and body composition were collected.
      Results: Serum iron and transferrin saturation (TSAT) were increased
      significantly with increased serum ferritin (all p < 0.05). Total iron-binding
      capacity (TIBC) was decreased significantly with increased serum ferritin (p <
      0.05). Visceral fat mass (VF), android fat/total body fat mass, android-to-gynoid
      fat ratio (A/G ratio), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein were all increased
      significantly with increased serum ferritin (all p < 0.05). Patients with a high 
      A/G ratio (A/G ratio >== 1) had significantly higher serum iron, ferritin, and
      TSAT, but significantly lower TIBC. In the model adjusted for age and gender,
      higher ferritin levels were associated with a higher VF (all p < 0.05). Serum
      iron was positively correlated with the occurrence of a high A/G ratio (A/G ratio
      >== 1) after the adjustment of confounding factors [an odds ratio (OR = 1.09, 95%
      CI, 1.02-1.19, p = 0.02)]. With receiver operating curve analysis, the cutoff
      value of serum iron for a high A/G ratio was 18.56, and the area under the curve 
      was 0.771 (sensitivity 88.9%and specificity 63.9%, p = 0.01). Conclusion: Higher 
      serum iron and ferritin concentrations were positively associated with a higher
      VF. Higher serum iron concentrations were positively correlated with a high A/G
      ratio. This study indicates the potential relationship between iron overload and 
      the body composition in patients with T2DM.

TI  - Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Dapagliflozin Plus Standard Treatment for Patients
      With Type 2 Diabetes and High Risk of Cardiovascular Disease in China.
PG  - 936703
LID - 10.3389/fpubh.2022.936703 [doi]
AB  - Purpose: To evaluate the long-term cost-effectiveness of dapagliflozin, in
      addition to standard treatment, for the treatment of adult patients with type 2
      diabetes (T2DM) at high cardiovascular risk from the Chinese healthcare system
      perspective. Methods: A decision-analytic Markov model with one-year cycles was
      developed to evaluate the health and economic outcomes in patients with T2DM and 
      high risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) treated with standard treatment and
      dapagliflozin plus standard treatment for 30 years. Clinical data, cost, and
      utility data were extracted from databases or published literature.
      Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs (euro/ yen 2021) as well as
      incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated. Deterministic and 
      probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the uncertainty in
      the results. Results: Compared with standard treatment, dapagliflozin plus
      standard treatment was predicted to result in an additional 0.25 QALYs (12.26
      QALYs vs. 12.01 QALYs) at an incremental cost of euro4,435.81 ( yen33,875.83) per
      patient. The ICER for dapagliflozin plus standard treatment vs. standard
      treatment was euro17,742.07 ( yen135,494.41) per QALY gained, which was
      considered cost-effective in China compared to three times the GDP per capita in 
      2021 (euro31,809.77/ yen242,928). The deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity
      analyses showed the base-case results to be robust. Conclusions: The study
      suggests that, from the perspective of the Chinese health system, dapagliflozin
      plus standard treatment is a cost-effective option for patients with T2DM at high
      cardiovascular risk. These findings may help clinicians make the best treatment
      decisions for patients with T2DM at high cardiovascular risk.

      Continuity and Coordination in Diabetes Patient Management Care in China.
PG  - 843217
LID - 10.3389/fpubh.2022.843217 [doi]
AB  - Background: As the first step toward building a gatekeeping system in China, the 
      governments have introduced a contracted family doctor service (CFDS) policy in
      primary healthcare (PHC) facilities. This study was to examine the association
      between apply of incentive to improve the implementation of CFDS and the
      performance on diabetes management care. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional 
      study in 72 PHC facilities in 6 cities that piloted the CFDS. Multivariate
      regression models were applied, based on a sample of 827 PHC providers and 420
      diabetic patients. Results: PHC providers who reported the performance being
      linked with increased income were 168.1 and 78.0% more likely to have good
      continuity and coordination of diabetes patient management care, respectively.
      Additional one-point percentage of PHC providers whose performance on CFDS was
      assessed was associated with 7.192 times higher probability of patients with
      control of blood glucose. Discussion: Inclusion of incentives rewarding better
      performance on CFDS were associated with better delivery process and outcome
      performance on diabetes management care. Conclusion: Design and implementation of
      the incentive should be accompanied with the policy of CFDS, in order to increase
      the proportion of performance-related income of PHC providers, thereby improving 
      the quality of diabetes management care.

TI  - Efficacy of dietary supplements targeting gut microbiota in the prevention and
      treatment of gestational diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 927883
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2022.927883 [doi]
AB  - Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a kind of metabolic disease occurring
      during gestation period, which often leads to adverse pregnancy outcomes and
      seriously harms the health of mothers and infants. The pathogenesis of GDM may be
      bound up with the abnormal gut microbiota composition in pregnant women. Previous
      studies have clarified that dietary supplements can regulate the gut microbiota
      to play a role. Therefore, using dietary supplements, such as probiotics,
      prebiotics, and synbiotics to target the gut microbiota to regulate the
      disordered gut microbiota would become a potential method that benefits for
      preventing and treating GDM. This paper reviews a series of clinical trials in
      recent years, expounds on the clinical effects of dietary supplements such as
      probiotics on GDM, and discusses the intervention effects of dietary supplements 
      on GDM related risk factors, including overweight, obesity, and type 2 diabetes
      mellitus (T2DM). In addition, the relationship of GDM and gut microbiota is also 
      discussed, and the possible mechanisms of dietary supplements are summarized.
      This review will help to promote the further development of dietary supplements
      targeting gut microbiota and provide more knowledge support for clinical
      application in the prevention and treatment of various diseases.

AB  - Objectives: The purpose of this study was to explore the effects of
      sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors on urine albumin to creatinine
      ratio (UACR) in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients and to recommend
      appropriate medication care scheme. Methods: 8371 T2DM patients from four
      dapagliflozin studies and two canagliflozin studies were collected for analyzing 
      with nonlinear mixed effect model (NONMEM). The change rates of UACR from
      baseline were intended to be evaluation indicators. Results: In the present
      study, there was no significant difference in the effects on UACR using
      dapagliflozin or canagliflozin treatment in T2DM patients. The maximal effect (E 
      max) and the treatment duration of reaching half of E max (ET50) from SGLT-2
      inhibitors on UACR in T2DM patients were -19.2% and 0.448 weeks, respectively.
      Further, the treatment duration to reach 25%, 50%, 75%, and 80% E max was 0.150
      weeks, 0.448 weeks, 1.344 weeks, and 1.792 weeks, respectively. Namely, for
      achieving the plateau period (80% of E max) of SGLT-2 inhibitors on UACR in T2DM 
      patients, 10 mg/day dapagliflozin (or 100 mg/day canagliflozin) should be taken
      for at least 1.792 weeks. Conclusions: To our knowledge, the present study
      explored the effects of SGLT-2 inhibitors on UACR in T2DM patients, meanwhile,
      recommended appropriate medication care scheme for the first time.

      the Course of Type 1 Diabetes: The SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth Study.
PG  - 8554991
LID - 10.1155/2022/8554991 [doi]
AB  - Objective: Hyperglycemia early in the course of type 1 diabetes (T1D) may
      increase the risk of cardiometabolic complications later in life. We tested the
      hypothesis that there were temporal trends in population-level glycemia and
      insulin pump use near T1D diagnosis among incident youth cohorts diagnosed
      between 2002 and 2016. Methods: Weighted and adjusted regression models were
      applied to data from the SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth study to analyze trends in 
      hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), suboptimal glycemia (HbA1c > 9% or not), and insulin pump
      use among youth with T1D within 30 months of diagnosis. We tested the interaction
      of year with race and ethnicity, sex, and insulin regimen to assess potential
      disparities. Results: Among the 3,956 youth with T1D, there was a small,
      clinically insignificant reduction in HbA1c between 2002 (7.9% +/- 1.5) and 2016 
      (7.8% +/- 2.4) (fully adjusted change by year (-0.013% [95% CI -0.026, -0.0008], 
      p = 0.04). The proportion of youth with suboptimal glycemia increased with each
      year, but the adjusted odds did not change. Insulin pump use increased more than 
      fivefold. Although interaction effects of time with race and ethnicity, sex, and 
      insulin regimen were not detected, in 2016, suboptimal glycemia was 4.3 and 1.8
      times more prevalent among Black and Hispanic than among non-Hispanic White
      youth, respectively. Conclusions: There was not a clinically significant
      population-level improvement in glycemia across incident youth cohorts early in
      the course of T1D, despite severalfold increases in insulin pump use.
      Comprehensive clinical interventions to improve glycemia early in the T1D course 
      and address disparities are urgently needed.

PG  - 893148
LID - 10.3389/fsurg.2022.893148 [doi]
AB  - Background: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a common metabolic disorder.
      Hyperglycemia may cause gestational hypertension, increase the probability of
      infection, abnormal embryonic development, and increase the abortion rate. Oral
      hypoglycemic drugs may be another effective means of blood glucose control in
      addition to insulin injection. We included controlled clinical studies for
      meta-analysis to understand the effect of oral hypoglycemic drugs in gestational 
      diabetes. Methods: The databases were searched with the keywords "Glycemic
      control" & "gestational diabetes": Embase (January, 2000-August, 2021), Pubmed
      (January, 2000-August, 2021), Web of Science (January, 2000-August, 2021), Ovid
      (January, 2000-August, 2021), and ClinicalTrials.org to obtain the randomized
      controlled trial (RCT) literatures related to the treatment of gestational
      diabetes with oral hypoglycemic drugs, after screening, the R language toolkit
      was used for the analysis. Results: A total of 10 articles with a total of 1,938 
      patients were included, 7 studies used metformin as an hypoglycemic agent.
      Meta-analysis showed that oral metformin had no significant difference in fasting
      blood glucose levels after the intervention compared with insulin injection [MD =
      -0.35, 95%CI(-0.70,1.40), Z = 0.66, P = 0.51], with no significant difference in 
      postprandial blood glucose levels after intervention [MD = -2.20,
      95%CI(-5.94,1.55), Z = -1.15, P = 0.25], and no statistical difference in
      glycosylated hemoglobin [MD = 0.10, 95%CI(-0.17,-0.04), Z = -0.94, P = 0.31].
      Metformin was more conducive to reducing maternal weight during pregnancy than
      insulin [MD = -1.55, 95%CI(-2.77,-0.34), Z = -2.5, P = 0.0123], metformin reduced
      the abortion rate compared with insulin [RR = 0.81, 95%CI(0.63,1.05), Z = -2.61, 
      P = 0.015], and reduced cesarean section rate [RR = 0.66, 95%CI(0.49,0.90), Z =
      -3.95, P = 0.0001]. Discussion: The application of oral hypoglycemic drug
      metformin in blood glucose control of gestational diabetes can play a
      hypoglycemic effect equivalent to insulin and can control the weight of pregnant 
      women, reduce the rate of abortion and cesarean section, and improve pregnancy
      outcomes.

      Remodeling the Gut Microbiota in Diabetes-Induced Cognitive Impairment Mice.
PG  - 898360
LID - 10.3389/fphar.2022.898360 [doi]
AB  - Background : Cognitive dysfunction is a critical complication of diabetes
      mellitus, and there are still no clinically approved drugs. Zi Shen Wan Fang
      (ZSWF) is an optimized prescription composed of Anemarrhenae Rhizoma,
      Phellodendri Chinensis Cortex, and Cistanches Herba. The purpose of this study is
      to investigate the effect of ZSWF on DCI and explore its mechanism from the
      perspective of maintaining intestinal microbial homeostasis in order to find an
      effective prescription for treating DCI. Methods: The diabetes model was
      established by a high-fat diet combined with intraperitoneal injections of
      streptozotocin (STZ, 120 mg/kg) and the DCI model was screened by Morris water
      maze (MWM) after 8 weeks of continuous hyperglycemic stimulation. The DCI mice
      were randomly divided into the model group (DCI), the low- and high-ZSWF-dose
      groups (9.63 g/kg, 18.72 g/kg), the mixed antibiotic group (ABs), and the ZSWF
      combined with mixed antibiotic group (ZSWF + ABs). ZSWF was administered orally
      once a day for 8 weeks. Then, cognitive function was assessed using MWM,
      neuroinflammation and systemic inflammation were analyzed by enzyme-linked
      immunosorbent assay kits, intestinal barrier integrity was assessed by
      hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining and Western blot and high performance liquid
      chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). Furthermore, the alteration
      to intestinal flora was monitored by 16S rDNA sequencing. Results: ZSWF restored 
      cognitive function in DCI mice and reduced levels of proinflammatory cytokines
      such as IL-1beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha. Moreover, ZSWF protected the integrity of 
      the intestinal barrier by increasing intestinal ZO-1 and occludin protein
      expression and decreasing urinary lactulose to mannitol ratio. In addition, ZSWF 
      reshaped the imbalanced gut microbiota in DCI mice by reversing the abundance
      changes of a wide range of intestinal bacteria at the phyla and genus levels. In 
      contrast, removing gut microbiota with antibiotics partially eliminated the
      effects of ZSWF on improving cognitive function and reducing inflammation,
      confirming the essential role of gut microbiota in the improvement of DCI by
      ZSWF. Conclusion: ZSWF can reverse cognitive impairment in DCI mice by remolding 
      the structure of destructed gut microbiota community, which is a potential
      Chinese medicine prescription for DCI treatment.

AB  - Most peripheral serotonin (5-HT) is synthesized in enterochromaffin cells, and
      most circulating 5-HT is stored in platelets. As a monoamine, 5-HT has several
      functions in various non-neuronal and neuronal systems. In the central nervous
      system, it functions as a neurotransmitter to modulate feeding behavior and mood.
      Numerous clinical trials have focused on increasing 5-HT activation in the
      central nervous system, including those involving anti-obesity drugs currently in
      the market, although severe side effects on peripheral system can lead to the
      withdrawal of certain drugs. Recent studies have revealed that both the
      peripheral and central serotonergic systems play a vital role in diabetes and its
      complications. This review summarizes the roles of the serotonergic system in
      blood glucose regulation, diabetic macroangiopathy, diabetic peripheral
      neuropathy, and diabetic encephalopathy, indicating its potential clinical
      significance as a therapeutic target for the treatment of diabetes and its
      complications.

      in Diabetes: A Comprehensive Review.
PG  - 3163-3176
LID - 10.2147/IJN.S363827 [doi]
AB  - Diabetic chronic wounds or amputation, which are complications of diabetes
      mellitus (DM), are a cause of great suffering for diabetics. In addition to the
      lack of oxygen, elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reduced
      vascularization, microbial invasion is also a critical factor that induces
      non-healing chronic diabetic wounds, ie, wounds still remaining in the stage of
      inflammation, after which the wound tissue begins to age and becomes necrotic. To
      clear up the infection, alleviate the inflammation in the wound and prevent
      necrosis, many kinds of hydrogel have been fabricated to eliminate infections
      with pathogens. The unique properties of hydrogels make them ideally suited to
      wound dressings because they provide a moist environment for wound healing and
      act as a barrier against bacteria. This review article will mainly cover the
      recent developments and innovations of antibacterial hydrogels for diabetic
      chronic wound healing.

      Patients With Diabetes.
PG  - 936573
LID - 10.3389/fendo.2022.936573 [doi]
AB  - Background: The optimal break-in period (BI) of urgent-start peritoneal dialysis 
      (USPD) initiation for patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and diabetes
      is unclear. We aimed to explore the safety and applicability of a BI </=24 h in
      patients with ESRD and diabetes. Methods: We used a retrospective cohort design
      wherein we recruited patients with ESRD and diabetes who underwent USPD at five
      institutions in China between January 2013 and August 2020. The enrolled patients
      were grouped according to BI. The primary outcomes were mechanical and infectious
      complication occurrences, whereas the secondary outcome was technique survival.
      Results: We enrolled 310 patients with diabetes, of whom 155 and 155 patients
      were in the BI </=24 h and BI >24 h groups, respectively. The two groups showed a
      comparable incidence of infectious and mechanical complications within 6 months
      after catheter insertion (p>0.05). Logistic regression analysis revealed that a
      BI </=24 h was not an independent risk factor for mechanical or infectious
      complications. Kaplan-Meier estimates showed no statistically significant
      between-group differences in technique survival rates (p>0.05). Cox multivariate 
      regression analysis revealed that a BI </=24 h was not an independent risk factor
      for technique failure. Conclusion: USPD initiation with a BI </=24 h may be safe 
      and feasible for patients with ESRD and diabetes.

AB  - Objective: Studies have shown that sex differences in lean mass, concentrations
      of sex hormones, and lifestyles influence cle health and glucose metabolism. We
      evaluated the sex-specific association between low muscle mass and glucose
      fluctuations in hospitalized patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)
      receiving continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) therapy. Methods: A
      total of 1084 participants were included. Body composition was determined by
      dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Intraday blood glucose fluctuation was
      estimated by the Largest amplitude of glycemic excursions (LAGE) and standard
      deviation of blood glucose (SDBG). Results: The prevalence of low muscle mass was
      higher in males than in females (p<0.001). There was a significant sex-specific
      interaction between the status of low muscle mass and glucose fluctuations (LAGE 
      and SDBG) (p for interaction=0.025 and 0.036 for SDBG and LAGE, respectively).
      Among males, low muscle mass was significantly associated with a higher LAGE and 
      SDBG (difference in LAGE: 2.26 [95% CI: 1.01 to 3.51], p < 0.001; difference in
      SDBG: 0.45 [95% CI: 0.25 to 0.65], p < 0.001) after adjustment for HbA1c,
      diabetes duration, hyperlipidemia, diabetic peripheral neuropathy, diabetic
      nephropathy, and cardiovascular disease. These associations remained significant 
      after further adjustment for age and C-peptide. Among females, low muscle mass
      was not associated with LAGE or SDBG after adjustment for all covariates.
      Conclusion: The prevalence of low muscle mass was higher in males than in
      females. Low muscle mass was significantly associated with higher LAGE and SDBG
      among males, but not females.

      Longitudinal Cohort Study.
PG  - 907973
LID - 10.3389/fendo.2022.907973 [doi]
AB  - Background: It has been proved that triglyceride glucose-body mass index
      (TyG-BMI) is a readily available and clinically significant indicator of insulin 
      resistance (IR). Nevertheless, the association between TyG-BMI and incident Type 
      2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) remains uncertain. This study aimed to study the
      relationship between TyG-BMI and T2DM and explore the predictive characteristics 
      of TyG-BMI. Methods: Our study was conducted as a longitudinal cohort study.
      8,430 men and 7,034 women were enrolled and analyzed. They were both non-diabetic
      subjects with normal glycemic levels. Follow-up lasted for 13 years, from 1994 to
      2016. To make the number of TyG-BMI in each group similar, the subjects were
      divided into four groups with 3866 subjects in each group. Results: During the
      13-year follow-up period, 373 subjects were diagnosed with incident T2DM. Our
      multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that TyG-BMI was an independent
      predictor of incident T2DM. In addition, our research identified four specific
      groups, young people (18-44 years old), women, the non-hypertensive population
      and non-drinkers were at significantly higher risk of developing TyG-BMI-related 
      diabetes (P-interaction< 0.05). The best threshold TyG-BMI for predicting
      incident T2DM was 197.2987 (area under the curve 0.7738). Conclusions: Our
      longitudinal cohort study demonstrated the positive correlation between baseline 
      TyG-BMI and risk of incident T2DM in Japanese with normal glycemic levels, and
      this risk was significantly higher in the young people, women, the
      non-hypertensive population and non-drinkers.

AB  - Objective: Increasing evidence highlighted that chronic inflammation involved in 
      the development of metabolic syndrome (MetS) and Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
      This prospective study was aimed to assess the association between MetS and novel
      pro-inflammatory indicators like monocyte-to-high-density lipoprotein and
      monocyte-to-apolipoprotein A1 ratios (MHR and MAR) in Chinese newly diagnosed
      T2DM. Method: A total of 605 Chinese newly diagnosed T2DM with complete and
      available data were enrolled in this study. Demographic and anthropometric
      information were collected. Laboratory assessments were determined by standard
      methods. MetS was based on the Chinese Diabetes Society definition. Multiple
      binomial logistic regression model was used to estimate the independent variables
      of MHR and MAR for MetS. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was
      conducted to assess the optimal cutoff value of MHR and MAR in identifying MetS. 
      Results: Overall, the prevalence of MetS was 60.2%. The correlation analysis
      showed that MHR and MAR were closely correlated with metabolic risk factors like 
      body mass index, waist circumference, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein
      cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, uric acid, and
      insulin resistance. MHR and MAR were also significantly associated with higher
      odds of MetS after adjustment for other confounders, the odds ratios (ORs)
      (95%CI) were 1.50 (1.14-1.97) and 2.26(1.79-2.87) respectively. Furthermore, MHR 
      and MAR were also seemed to have higher area under the curve (AUC) for MetS than 
      ApoA1 and monocyte alone from the ROC curve analysis (P < 0.05). The AUCs of MHR 
      and MAR identifying MetS were 0.804 (95% CI: 0.768-0.839) and 0.840 (95% CI:
      0.806-0.873) respectively (P < 0.001). The optimal cutoff values of MHR and MAR
      were 3.57 x 10(8)/mmol (sensitivity: 76.1%, specificity: 73.4%) and 3.95 x
      10(8)/g (sensitivity: 79.7%, specificity: 84.6%), respectively. Conclusions: MHR 
      and MAR were significantly associated with MetS. These two novel pro-inflammatory
      indicators may be useful markers for MetS in Chinese newly diagnosed T2DM.

PG  - 892702
LID - 10.3389/fendo.2022.892702 [doi]
AB  - Aims: This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness and tolerability of
      once-weekly glucagon-like peptide receptor agonists (OW GLP-1RAs) and to assess
      the clinical benefits of switching from one GLP-1RA to another (switchers) in a
      routine clinical setting. Materials and Methods: This is a retrospective,
      real-world cohort study, based on electronic medical records utilized in one
      Italian diabetes clinic. Estimated mean changes in HbA1c and body weight after 6 
      and 12 months from the first prescription of a long-acting GLP1-RA were evaluated
      using longitudinal linear mixed models for repeated measures. The effectiveness
      of the three long-acting GLP1-RAs was compared separately in the GLP1-RA naive
      and switchers cohorts, after propensity score adjustment. Results: Initiating a
      long-acting GLP1-RA was associated with statistically significant improvements in
      HbA1c (-1%) and body weight (-2.6 kg) after 6 months, and benefits were
      maintained after 12 months. In GLP1-RA naive cohort, semaglutide showed the
      largest effect on HbA1c (-1.55%; 95%CI, -1.77;-1.34) and body weight (-3.76 kg;
      95%CI, -5.05;-2.47) at 6 months, maintained at 12 months (-1.55%; 95%CI,
      -1.82;-1.28 and -6.29 kg; 95%CI, -7.94;-4.63). In the switchers' cohort,
      statistically significant reductions at 6 months in HbA1c and body weight were
      documented with semaglutide and dulaglutide only, with semaglutide associated
      with the most marked reduction (-0.84%; 95%CI, -1.03;-0.65 and -3.43 kg; 95%,
      -4.67;-2.19). Dropout rates were 9.2%, 28.5%, and 41.7% in semaglutide,
      dulaglutide, and exenatide groups, respectively. Conclusions: The effectiveness
      and tolerability of the OW GLP-1RAs in the real world were documented.
      Semaglutide was associated with the highest response without impact on safety.
      Clinical improvements were obtained even in switchers, especially in those
      switching to semaglutide.

AB  - Background: Fibroblast growth factor 21 increased in population with type 2
      diabetes mellitus (T2DM), while serum total testosterone often decreased in men
      with T2DM. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between the
      prevalence of coronary artery disease (CAD) and circulating FGF21 concentrations 
      and serum testosterone in T2DM men. Methods: 490 men with T2DM from January 2021 
      to December 2021 were recruited from the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, and
      they were divided into CAD group (n=248) and control group (n=242). FGF21 were
      determined based on ELISA principle and serum total testosterone was measured in 
      a liquid chromatography mass spectrometer LC/MS-8050 (Shimadzu, Japan). Logistic 
      and restricted cubic spline analyses were performed to examine the association
      between the prevalence of CAD and circulating FGF21 concentrations and serum
      testosterone in T2DM men. The receiver operating curve (ROC) analysis was used to
      explore the predictive performance. Results: Circulating FGF21 levels were higher
      in T2DM men with CAD compared with those without CAD [214.63 (121.82, 348.64)
      pg/ml vs 166.55 (94.81,254.48) pg/ml, p<0.001], while serum total testosterone
      was lower [3.08 +/- 0.07 ng/ml vs 3.76 +/- 0.09 ng/ml, p<0.001]. The fully
      adjusted odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) was
      2.956(1.409,6.201) for those in quartile 4 of FGF21 versus quartile 1 and the
      fully adjusted OR (95%CI) was 0.346(0.174,0.686) for those in quartile 4 of
      testosterone versus quartile 1. The receiver operating curve (ROC) analysis
      showed that the area under the curve (AUC) of combination of FGF21 and
      testosterone for predicting the occurrence of CAD in men with T2DM was 0.702 (95%
      CI: 0.667-0.741). Conclusion: Circulating FGF21 levels were positively associated
      with CAD in men with T2DM, whereas serum total testosterone levels showed an
      inverse correlation with CAD in diabetic men.

AB  - Aims: To develop and validate a nomogram prediction model for the risk of
      diabetic foot in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and evaluate its
      clinical application value. Methods: We retrospectively collected clinical data
      from 1,950 patients with T2DM from the Second Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an
      Jiaotong University between January 2012 and June 2021. The patients were divided
      into training cohort and validation cohort according to the random number table
      method at a ratio of 7:3. The independent risk factors for diabetic foot among
      patients with T2DM were identified by multivariate logistic regression analysis. 
      Then, a nomogram prediction model was developed using the independent risk
      factors. The model performances were evaluated by the area under the receiver
      operating characteristic curve (AUC), calibration plot, Hosmer-Lemeshow test, and
      the decision curve analysis (DCA). Results: Multivariate logistic regression
      analysis indicated that age, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), low-density lipoprotein
      (LDL), total cholesterol (TC), smoke, and drink were independent risk factors for
      diabetic foot among patients with T2DM (P < 0.05). The AUCs of training cohort
      and validation cohort were 0.806 (95% CI: 0.775 approximately 0.837) and 0.857
      (95% CI: 0.814 approximately 0.899), respectively, suggesting good discrimination
      of the model. Calibration curves of training cohort and validation cohort showed 
      a favorable consistency between the predicted probability and the actual
      probability. In addition, the P values of Hosmer-Lemeshow test for training
      cohort and validation cohort were 0.826 and 0.480, respectively, suggesting a
      high calibration of the model. When the threshold probability was set as 11.6% in
      the DCA curve, the clinical net benefits of training cohort and validation cohort
      were 58% and 65%, respectively, indicating good clinical usefulness of the model.
      Conclusion: We developed and validated a user-friendly nomogram prediction model 
      for the risk of diabetic foot in patients with T2DM. Nomograms may help
      clinicians early screen and identify patients at high risk of diabetic foot.

LID - 10.1155/2022/8494868 [doi]
AB  - The efficacy of tympanum injection and posterior auricular injection in diabetes 
      with sudden hearing loss (SHL) was analyzed. A mobile terminal-based portable
      pure tone audiometry system and its processing method were established. Based on 
      mobile terminals, a portable pure tone audiometry system including an Android
      system, pure sound signal generation, pure tone hearing threshold, and client
      module was established. A masking model and self-adaptive algorithm were used to 
      detect and reduce noise. Besides, the performance of the portable pure tone
      audiometry system was detected. A total of 46 diabetes patients with SHL
      diagnosed at the otolaryngology department in BeiChen Hospital between August
      2019 and November 2021 were selected as the research objects and randomly divided
      into the retroauricular group (posterior auricular injection) and the tympanic
      group (tympanum injection). Each group included 23 cases. All patients received
      pure tone audiometry (PTA) before and after the treatment. The changes in fasting
      blood glucose (FPG), 2h postprandial blood glucose (2hPG), and glycosylated
      hemoglobin (HbA1c) of the patients were monitored before and after the treatment.
      Besides, tinnitus loudness visual analog scale (VAS), pain VAS, efficacy, and the
      incidence of adverse reactions of the patients in two groups were compared. The
      results indicated that the hear threshold error detected by the medical
      audiometer and a portable pure tone audiometry system was within 2dB. Before the 
      optimization, there was an error of about 10dB between the hear thresholds
      detected by the self-adaptive algorithm and a medical audiometer. After the
      treatment, the hear threshold and average PTA of the patients in the
      retroauricular and the tympanic groups under different frequencies were both
      reduced compared with those before the treatment (P < 0.05). The tinnitus VAS
      score in the retroauricular group was decreased more notably than that in
      tympanic group (P < 0.01), and the pain VAS score was much lower than that in the
      tympanic group (P < 0.001). The comparison of FPG, 2hPG, HbA1c, the proportions
      of cured, significantly effective, effective, ineffective patients, and the total
      effective rate in the patients in the retroauricular and the tympanic groups
      before and after the treatment all showed no statistical differences (P > 0.05). 
      The incidence of adverse reactions in tympanic group after the treatment was
      dramatically higher than that in retroauricular group (P < 0.001). The above
      results demonstrated that posterior auricular injection showed potential
      application values in the treatment of SHL with diabetes and established a
      portable pure tone audiometry system as well as its noise processing method.

AB  - Introduction: the simplified diabetes knowledge scale is used to obtain a general
      assessment of diabetic s knowledge about diabetes and its care. For clinical and 
      methodological purposes, it was relevant and necessary to develop an Arabic
      version of this instrument. Thus, the aim of this study was to translate and
      validate the simplified diabetes knowledge scale (SDKS) into Arabic to measure
      the knowledge of Arabic-speaking diabetics. Methods: a methodological validation 
      study of the simplified diabetes knowledge scale, following the guidelines of
      Vallerand was carried out. A convenience sample of diabetics followed in eight
      basic health centers in Sousse region and in Farhat Hached and Sahloul University
      Hospitals was recruited. An Arabic questionnaire including the demographic and
      clinical data of the diabetic and the final experimental version of the
      simplified diabetes knowledge scale was used. Results: a sample of 333 diabetics 
      was recruited. Content validity of the final experimental version was 0.94.
      Reliability assessed by Cronbach s alpha coefficient (0.812), by test-retest
      correlation coefficient (> 0.60) and by internal consistency after deletion of
      each item (from 0.788 to 0.816) were acceptable except items 19 and 20 which had 
      to be reformulated. Construct validity analysis identified that three items among
      the 20 ones (12, 17 and 20) required reformulation. Inter-item correlation matrix
      showed that the majority of items were not correlated with each other. Validation
      process was ended by establishing standards table. Conclusion: this study showed 
      the Arabic version of the simplified diabetes knowledge scale had good validity
      and reliability.

TI  - A clinical model and nomogram for early prediction of gestational diabetes based 
      on common maternal demographics and routine clinical parameters.
LID - 10.1111/jog.15380 [doi]
AB  - AIM: We aimed to develop a risk prediction model for gestational diabetes
      mellitus (GDM) based on the common maternal demographics and routine clinical
      variables in Chinese population. METHODS: Individual information was collected
      from December 2018 to October 2019 by a pretested questionnaire on demographics, 
      medical and family history, and lifestyle factors. Multivariable logistic
      regression was performed to establish a predictive model for GDM by variables in 
      pre- and early pregnancy. The consistency and discriminative validity of the
      model were evaluated by Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit testing and ROC curve
      analysis. Internal validation was appraised by fivefold cross-validation.
      Clinical utility was assessed by decision curve analysis. RESULTS: Total 3263
      pregnant women were included with 17.2% prevalence of GDM. The model equation
      was: LogitP = -11.432 + 0.065 x maternal age (years) + 0.061 x pre-pregnancy BMI 
      (kg/m(2) ) + 0.055 x weight gain in early pregnancy (kg) + 0.872 x history of GDM
      + 0.336 x first-degree family history of diabetes +0.213 x sex hormone usages
      during pre- or early pregnancy + 1.089 x fasting glucose (mmol/L) + 0.409 x
      triglycerides (mmol/L) + 0.082 x white blood cell count (109/L) + 0.669 x
      positive urinary glucose. Homer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit testing indicated a good
      consistency between predictive and actual data (p = 0.586). The area under the
      ROC curve (AUC) was 0.720 (95% CI: 0.697 ~ 0.744). Cross-validation suggested a
      good internal validity of the model. A nomogram has been made to establish an
      easy to use scoring system for clinical practice. CONCLUSIONS: The predictive
      model of GDM exhibited well acceptable predictive ability, discriminative
      performance, and clinical utilities. The project was registered in
      clinicaltrial.gov.com with identifier of NCT03922087.

AB  - AIMS: To understand the associations between sociodemographic factors, self-rated
      health, and COVID-19-related changes in physical activity and diet and the
      reported number of days per week participants engaged in physical activity and
      consumed fruits and vegetables for people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
      METHODS: Respondents from Arkansas primary care clinics completed a survey
      between October 2020 and January 2021. Multivariable regression determined
      associations between sociodemographic factors, self-rated health, and
      COVID-19-related changes in physical activity and diet and the reported number of
      days per week participants engaged in physical activity and consumed fruits and
      vegetables. RESULTS: Respondents exercised for at least 30 min on a mean of 2.09 
      days and consumed five or more fruit and vegetable servings on a mean of 3.57
      days. Males engaged in one additional day of physical activity compared to women.
      Respondents with a college degree or higher ate 5 or more fruit and vegetable
      servings on fewer days per week than those with a high school education or less. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Results reaffirm a need for diabetes education programs and health
      care providers to provide information on the importance of maintaining physical
      activity and a healthy diet as part of a self-care plan for T2DM, especially
      during public health emergencies like the COVID-19 pandemic.

TI  - Pharmacists' Adherence Support System FollowNavi for Patients with Type 2
      Diabetes.
PG  - 1091-1100
LID - 10.1248/bpb.b22-00121 [doi]
AB  - In Japan, the Pharmaceutical and Medical Device Act was amended in December 2019 
      and now requires pharmacists to follow-up patients continuously during treatment 
      to ensure proper use of medicines. According to some reports on patients with
      type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), follow-up by doctors is effective for improving 
      treatment. Enhanced face-to-face medication counseling by pharmacists leads to
      good glycemic control in patients with diabetes. However, the effects of
      information and communication technology (ICT)-based follow-up during the
      medication period are not well-understood. We determined the efficacy of
      pharmacists' follow-up using FollowNavi, a patient compliance instruction support
      system, and using our developed LINE tool for patients with T2DM. Through a
      before-after study, changes in glycemic control and medication adherence after 6 
      months of follow-up were investigated, and multiple regression analysis was
      performed to investigate the factors associated with changes in hemoglobin A1c
      (HbA1c) levels. Questionnaire surveys related to usability were completed by
      patients and pharmacists. In the 35 patients with T2DM, HbA1c levels decreased
      significantly after 6 months, although fasting blood glucose levels and
      medication adherence showed no significant differences. Changes in HbA1c levels
      were significantly associated with age (p = 0.044), baseline HbA1c levels (p <
      0.001), and diabetes duration (p = 0.004). In the questionnaire, 81.8% of
      patients responded that they would prefer to continue using FollowNavi. These
      results suggest that follow-up using FollowNavi is useful for glycemic control in
      patients with T2DM.

AB  - Dapagliflozin has been demonstrated to improve glycemic control, blood pressure, 
      and body weight in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D); indeed, it can also reduce the
      risk of progression to renal failure, of hospitalization for heart failure and of
      cardiovascular death. We aim to investigate the acute effect of Dapagliflozin on 
      kidney function in the common clinical practice in T2D. This is a study including
      1402 patients with T2D recruited from 11 centers in Lombardia, Italy, who were
      evaluated at baseline and after 6 months of treatment with Dapagliflozin 10 mg
      per day. The primary outcome of the study was the change in HbA1c, while the
      secondary outcomes were modification of weight, BMI, systolic and diastolic
      pressure, creatinine, eGFR and albuminuria status. After 24 weeks of treatment
      with Dapagliflozin, a reduction in Hb1Ac was observed (-0.6 +/- 1.8%) as well as 
      in BMI (-1.5 +/- 5.2 kg/m(2)). Statistically significant changes were also found 
      for systolic and diastolic blood pressure, cholesterol and triglycerides.
      Interestingly, a statistically significant acute improvement of kidney function
      was evident. Our analyses confirm the beneficial effects of dapagliflozin after 6
      months of therapy, with improvements of glycemic and lipid profiles, blood
      pressure, BMI. Finally, an acute positive effect on albuminuria and KIDGO classes
      was observed during a 6 months treatment with dapagliflozin in patients with T2D.

AB  - Diabetes mellitus (DM), also called diabetes, is a chronic metabolic disorder,
      with complications that include failure of immune responses, such as immune cell 
      proliferation and activation. The current study investigated changes in natural
      killer (NK) cell activity under diabetic conditions. To demonstrate the influence
      of hyperglycemia on NK cell activity, type 1 and 2 diabetes models were
      constructed using C57/BL6 mice. NK cells isolated from mice with either type 1 or
      2 diabetes showed lower cytotoxic activity against cancer cells than NK cells
      isolated from healthy control mice, and the longer the duration since induction
      of diabetes, the lower was the cytotoxic activity. Moreover, in the diabetic
      mouse models, fewer NK cells expressed activation markers, such as NKG2D and
      NKp46, compared to NK cells from control mice. Production of the apoptosis
      inducer, granzyme B, was also lower in NK cells from diabetic mice than control
      mice. These results demonstrate that high glucose conditions influence NK cell
      activity.

TI  - Detecting Sarcopenia Risk by Diabetes Clustering: A Japanese Prospective Cohort
      Study.
LID - dgac430 [pii]
LID - 10.1210/clinem/dgac430 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Previous studies have assessed the usefulness of data-driven clustering 
      for predicting complications in patients with diabetes mellitus. However, whether
      the diabetes clustering is useful in predicting sarcopenia remains unclear.
      OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the predictive power of diabetes clustering for the
      incidence of sarcopenia in a prospective Japanese cohort. DESIGN: Three-year
      prospective cohort study. SETTING AND PATIENTS: We recruited Japanese patients
      with type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus (n = 659) between January 2018 and
      February 2020 from the Fukushima Diabetes, Endocrinology, and Metabolism (DEM)
      cohort. INTERVENTIONS: Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards models were used
      to measure the predictive values of the conventional and clustering-based
      classification of diabetes mellitus for the onset of sarcopenia. Sarcopenia was
      diagnosed according to the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia (AWGS) 2019
      consensus update. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Onset of sarcopenia. RESULTS: Cluster
      analysis of a Japanese population revealed five diabetes clusters: cluster 1
      (severe autoimmune diabetes [SAID]), cluster 2 (severe insulin-deficient diabetes
      [SIDD]), cluster 3 (severe insulin-resistant diabetes [SIRD]), cluster 4 (mild
      obesity-related diabetes), and cluster 5 (mild age-related diabetes). At
      baseline, 38 (6.5%) patients met the AWGS sarcopenia criteria and 55 had newly
      developed sarcopenia within three years. SAID and SIDD were clusters at high risk
      of developing sarcopenia after correction for known risk factors. CONCLUSIONS:
      This study reveals that SAID and SIDD are clusters at a high-risk for developing 
      sarcopenia among the five diabetes clusters. Clustering-based stratification may 
      be beneficial for predicting and preventing sarcopenia in patients with diabetes.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The prevalence of diabetes mellitus is increasing worldwide.
      According to Hungarian data from 2014, it affects 7,3% of the population. At the 
      time of their cancer diagnosis, 8-18% of all patients have preexisting diabetes
      mellitus. Some studies have identified a diabetes prevalence up to 30% of cancer 
      patients. The treatment of diabetic patients in palliative care differs from the 
      curative methods and this is very important to be communicated with the patient, 
      the family members and health-care providers. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this
      publication is to develop a method of control and treatment of the palliative
      care patients with diabetes mellitus. METHOD: Based on studies in international
      literature, a suggestion can be made that can be applied in domestic practice.
      SUGGESTIONS: This suggestion introduces individual and more liberal control and
      management methods for a better quality of life in this special patient group.
      CONCLUSION: The suggestion for the treatment of diabetes helps provide quality
      care for palliative patients. Orv Hetil. 2022; 163(31): 1231-1236.

TI  - Ultrasound-guided hydrodistension for adhesive capsulitis: a longitudinal study
      on the effect of diabetes on treatment outcomes.
LID - 10.1007/s00256-022-04141-2 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The effect of diabetes on adhesive capsulitis (AC) and its impact on
      the outcomes of ultrasound (US)-guided hydrodistension of the glenohumeral joint 
      are still unclear. We aimed to identify predictors of US-guided hydrodistension
      outcomes, while assessing the performance of the method in diabetic compared to
      non-diabetic patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 135 patients with AC who
      underwent US-guided hydrodistension were prospectively included. Demographics and
      factors linked to chronic inflammation and diabetes were recorded and patients
      were followed-up for 6 months. Functionality and pain were evaluated with the
      Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) and the Visual Analogue Scale
      (VAS) score. Statistical analysis was performed with Mann-Whitney U test, linear,
      and binary logistic regression. RESULTS: Diabetes was identified in 25/135
      patients (18.5%). Diabetic patients had worse DASH and VAS score at presentation 
      (P < 0.0001) and presented with a higher grade of AC (P < 0.0001) and lower range
      of motion (P < 0.01) compared to non-diabetics. Higher DASH (P = 0.025) and VAS
      scores (P = 0.039) at presentation were linked to worse functionality at 6
      months. Presence and duration of diabetes, and the number of hydrodistension
      repeats, correlated with worse VAS and DASH scores at 6 months. The number of
      procedure repeats was the only independent predictor of complete pain resolution 
      at 6 months (OR 0.418, P = 003). CONCLUSION: Diabetes is linked to more severe AC
      at presentation and worse outcomes in patients undergoing US-guided
      hydrodistension. In resistant cases, repeating the intervention is independently 
      linked to worse outcomes for at least 6 months post-intervention.

TI  - Intestinal lipid absorption and transport in type 2 diabetes.
LID - 10.1007/s00125-022-05765-8 [doi]
AB  - Postprandial hyperlipidaemia is an important feature of diabetic dyslipidaemia
      and plays an important role in the development of cardiovascular disease in
      individuals with type 2 diabetes. Postprandial hyperlipidaemia in type 2 diabetes
      is secondary to increased chylomicron production by the enterocytes and delayed
      catabolism of chylomicrons and chylomicron remnants. Insulin and some intestinal 
      hormones (e.g. glucagon-like peptide-1 [GLP-1]) influence intestinal lipid
      metabolism. In individuals with type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance and possibly 
      reduced GLP-1 secretion are involved in the pathophysiology of postprandial
      hyperlipidaemia. Several factors are involved in the overproduction of
      chylomicrons: (1) increased expression of microsomal triglyceride transfer
      protein, which is a key enzyme in chylomicron synthesis; (2) higher stability and
      availability of apolipoprotein B-48; and (3) increased de novo lipogenesis.
      Individuals with type 2 diabetes present with disorders of cholesterol metabolism
      in the enterocytes with reduced absorption and increased synthesis. The increased
      production of chylomicrons in type 2 diabetes is also associated with a reduction
      in their catabolism, mostly because of a reduction in activity of lipoprotein
      lipase. Modification of the microbiota, which is observed in type 2 diabetes, may
      also generate disorders of intestinal lipid metabolism, but human data remain
      limited. Some glucose-lowering treatments significantly influence intestinal
      lipid absorption and transport. Postprandial hyperlipidaemia is reduced by
      metformin, pioglitazone, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, dipeptidyl peptidase 4
      inhibitors and GLP-1 agonists. The most pronounced effect is observed with GLP-1 
      agonists, which reduce chylomicron production significantly in individuals with
      type 2 diabetes and have a direct effect on the intestine by reducing the
      expression of genes involved in intestinal lipoprotein metabolism. The effect of 
      sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors on intestinal lipid metabolism needs to
      be clarified.

TI  - Changes of bile acids and resting energy expenditure after laparoscopic
      cholecystectomy in type 2 diabetes patients: a prospective study.
PG  - 108
LID - 10.1186/s13098-022-00880-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We aimed to investigate changes of bile acids and resting energy
      expenditure (REE) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) after
      laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) and the role in metabolic homeostasis. METHODS:
      From December 2019 to December 2021, a total of 77 T2DM patients with gallbladder
      polyps were included in our study. Among them, 40 patients who underwent LC were 
      enrolled into the cholecystectomy group, and 37 patients who did not undergo LC
      were enrolled into the control group. Preoperative and 6-months postoperative
      demographic data, body weight, food intake, effects on diabetes control, and
      biomedical variables were recorded and compared. RESULTS: The mean level of total
      bile acids (TBA) was higher than that in the control group (P = 0.033) and
      increased significantly after LC compared to baseline (P = 0.029). The REE level 
      in the cholecystectomy group was higher than that in the control group (P =
      0.032) and increased compared to the baseline (P = 0.011). The utilization of
      carbohydrates increased significantly after LC (P < 0.001) while the utilization 
      of fat decreased (P < 0.001). The mean level of fasting plasma glucose (P =
      0.004), hemoglobin A1C (P < 0.001), and homeostasis model assessment-insulin
      resistance (P = 0.045) decreased after LC. The mean level of total cholesterol (P
      = 0.003) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol significantly decreased (P =
      0.021), whereas the level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol increased (P < 
      0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The level of REE and TBA increased after LC in patients with
      T2DM, and the glucose and lipid metabolism improved. Trial registration This
      study was registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry on November 30, 2018,
      registered number: ChiCTR1900027823.

TI  - Activity tracker-based intervention to increase physical activity in patients
      with type 2 diabetes and healthy individuals: study protocol for a randomized
      controlled trial.
PG  - 617
LID - 10.1186/s13063-022-06550-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: One relevant strategy to prevent the onset and progression of type 2 
      diabetes mellitus (T2DM) focuses on increasing physical activity. The use of
      activity trackers by patients could enable objective measurement of their regular
      physical activity in daily life and promote physical activity through the use of 
      a tracker-based intervention. This trial aims to answer three research questions:
      (1) Is the use of activity trackers suitable for longitudinal assessment of
      physical activity in everyday life? (2) Does the use of a tracker-based
      intervention lead to sustainable improvements in the physical activity of healthy
      individuals and in people with T2DM? (3) Does the accompanying digital
      motivational intervention lead to sustainable improvements in physical activity
      for participants using the tracker-based device? METHODS: The planned study is a 
      randomized controlled trial focused on 1642 participants with and without T2DM
      for 9 months with regard to their physical activity behavior. Subjects allocated 
      to an intervention group will wear an activity tracker. Half of the subjects in
      the intervention group will also receive an additional digital motivational
      intervention. Subjects allocated to the control group will not receive any
      intervention. The primary outcome is the amount of moderate and vigorous physical
      activity in minutes and the number of steps per week measured continuously with
      the activity tracker and assessed by questionnaires at four time points.
      Secondary endpoints are medical parameters measured at the same four time points.
      The collected data will be analyzed using inferential statistics and explorative 
      data-mining techniques. DISCUSSION: The trial uses an interdisciplinary approach 
      with a team including sports psychologists, sports scientists, health scientists,
      health care professionals, physicians, and computer scientists. It also involves 
      the processing and analysis of large amounts of data collected with activity
      trackers. These factors represent particular strengths as well as challenges in
      the study. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial is registered at the World Health
      Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform via the German
      Clinical Studies Trial Register (DRKS), DRKS00027064 . Registered on 11 November 
      2021.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is considered as one of the major public
      health problems globally. Health education strategies can help in managing blood 
      glucose level and complications among DM patients. Health education intervention 
      is effective to manage and control the blood glucose levels among diabetic
      patients. This study explored the effectiveness of health education intervention 
      on DM among school teachers in public sector schools of Pakistan. METHODS: This
      was quasi-experimental study where baseline & end line assessments were conducted
      on teachers of public sector schools of Sindh province, Pakistan, from October to
      December 2019. Pretested structured questionnaire was used in this study.
      Participants (n = 136). were randomly selected from the list of government
      schools registered with district education department An intervention comprised
      of health education sessions with DM patients was undertaken after conducting
      baseline assessment followed by end line assessment. The institutional review
      board of Health Services Academy Pakistan ethically approved this study. RESULTS:
      All the respondents completed post-test with mean +/- SD age of participants
      being 39.2 +/- 1.34 years. Female teachers comprised 65% out of which 70% were
      living in rural areas. Knowledge on DM pre-test score was 20.03 +/- 3.31 that
      increased in post-test to 49.11 +/- 2.21 (p < 0.05). Mean score of information on
      symptoms and causes of DM was 1.98 +/- 0.21 for pre-test whereas for post-test it
      was 4.78 +/- 0.12 (p < 0.05). The effect of intervention was significant on
      diabetes related complications (p < 0.05), symptoms (p < 0.05), overall score (p 
      < 0.05) and preventive practices (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The study provides
      evidence of the importance and effectiveness of health education intervention
      related to diabetes among school teachers, which has a positive impact on the
      knowledge and practices. We concluded that the health education session
      sensitized the teachers and they can bring cogent changes to enhance their
      knowledge about diabetes and its risks.

AB  - Diabetes mellitus is a common condition associated with numerous complications
      and comorbidities. The diabetes spectrum includes type 1, type 2 and other forms 
      of diabetes, which may be associated with medical therapies and genetic factors. 
      Type 2 diabetes is managed with lifestyle, oral therapies, non-insulin-based
      injectables and subsequently insulin. Type 1 diabetes requires insulin from the
      time of diagnosis. In recent years, there have been considerable developments in 
      the therapies available to treat type 2 diabetes and some of these also afford
      cardiorenal protection. This review summarises the nature, complications and
      therapeutic advances in the field of diabetes and provides a concise review for
      neurologists. Managing diabetes optimally prevents complications and all medical 
      specialties need a basic understanding of the principles involved in diabetes
      care.

TI  - Is there a residual risk of large-for-gestational-age infant related to
      gestational diabetes mellitus when it is treated?

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The hyperglycaemia and adverse pregnancy outcomes (HAPO) study, where 
      hyperglycaemia was untreated, showed a continuous association between
      large-for-gestational-age (LGA) infant and seven increasing categories of fasting
      plasma glucose (PG), 1-hour and 2-hour PG values after a 75g oral glucose
      tolerance test at 24-32 gestational weeks. We evaluated whether the excess risk
      persisted in the 6th and 7th glucose categories - corresponding to women treated 
      for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We included 7,190 
      women meeting the HAPO criteria, of whom 655 (9.2%) were treated for GDM (dietary
      education in all; insulin therapy in 150 (20.3%)). We evaluated the adjusted odds
      ratio (aOR) for each glucose category (reference 1(st) category) for LGA infant. 
      RESULTS: The aOR for LGA linearly increased from the 1(st) to 5(th) categories of
      fasting, 1-hour and 2-hour PG. Specifically, the aORs for the 5(th) category were
      2.20 (95% confidence interval 1.41-3.44), 2.25 (1.11-4.59), and 2.51 (1.63-3.85),
      respectively. The aORs for the 6(th) category were globally stable at 2.52
      (1.46-4.36), 2.87 (1.48-5.54), and 2.47 (1.46-4.16), respectively. The same was
      true for the 7(th) category: 1.41 (0.56-3.55), 2.84 (1.03-7.86), and 3.53
      (1.77-7.06), respectively. CONCLUSION: We confirmed the association between
      increasing PG category and LGA infant in women without GDM. We did not observe a 
      residual risk of LGA infant in women treated for GDM in our hospital,
      irrespective of elevated fasting, 1-hour, or 2-hour PG diagnosis. The risk of LGA
      infant was globally similar to that in women with high normal glucose values.

AB  - AIMS: This study aimed to examine the association between body weight variability
      and dementia risk using a large-scale cohort data of Korean patients with type 2 
      diabetes mellitus (T2DM). METHODS: A population-based cohort of 1,206,764
      individuals with T2DM aged >/= 40 years who underwent >/= 3 Korean national
      health screenings were followed up until the end of 2019. Body weight variability
      was assessed using variability independent of the mean (VIM). A multivariate Cox 
      proportional hazard regression was performed with calculating hazard ratios (HRs)
      with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) of dementia incidence. RESULTS: During a
      median follow-up of 7.9 years, 162,615 (13.4 %) individuals developed dementia.
      Individuals with greater body weight variability tended to be associated with
      higher risk of all types of dementia (P for trend < 0.001). Individuals in the
      highest quartile of VIM showed 26 % (HR: 1.26, 95 % CI: 1.24-1.28), 33 % (HR:
      1.33, 95 % CI: 1.30-1.36) and 28 % (HR: 1.28, 95 % CI: 1.23-1.33) higher risk for
      all-cause dementia, Alzheimer's disease, and vascular dementia, compared with
      those in the lowest quartile. These associations persisted in all body mass index
      categories (P for trend < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Maintaining an appropriate body
      weight may help mitigate dementia risk in patients with T2DM.

AB  - AIMS: To evaluate the ability of first trimester plasma glycated CD59 (pGCD59) to
      predict gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) at 24-28 weeks of gestation. METHODS:
      Prospectively, in 378 pregnant women, GDM was diagnosed using the one step 2h 75g
      oral glucose tolerance test adjudicated by the World Health Organisation (WHO)
      2013 criteria. The ability of pGCD59 to predict GDM was assessed using receiver
      operating characteristic (ROC) curves adjusted for maternal age, body mass index 
      (BMI), maternal ethnicity, parity, previous GDM, family history of diabetes
      mellitus and week of gestation at time of pGCD59 sampling. RESULTS: pGCD59
      generated an adjusted area under the curve (AUC) of a) 0.63 (95%CI:0.56-0.70,
      p<0.001) for predicting GDM, and b) 0.71 (95%CI:0.62-0.79, p<0.001 for GDM
      diagnosed with a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) >/=5.1 mmol/L. Sensitivity analysis
      of BMI subgroups showed that pGCD59 generated the highest AUC in the 35 kg/m(2)
      </= BMI <40 kg/m(2) (AUC:0.85, 95%CI:0.70-0.98) and BMI >/=40 kg/m(2) (AUC:0.88, 
      95%CI:0.63-0.99) categories. CONCLUSIONS: Early in pregnancy, pGCD59 may be a
      good predictor of GDM in women with a high BMI and a fair predictor of GDM
      diagnosed by an elevated FPG independent of BMI.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to identify lifestyle patterns that are
      characteristic of overweight and obese European adults in the context of
      educational level. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of dietary data from
      1235 men and 10 343 women. Dietary intake, educational level, and physical
      activity were assessed using questionnaires. A principal component analysis was
      used to derive lifestyle patterns, and associations with being overweight or
      obese (OW/OB) and waist circumference (WC) were explored by applying a
      multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: Overall, 35% of women and 68% of men
      were OW/OB, of whom 30% and 40%, respectively, had </=12 y of education. The
      principal component analysis derived 2 distinct dietary patterns (healthy vs.
      unhealthy). The daily intake of fruits (fresh, canned, and juice) and vegetables 
      was found to be associated with lower odds of being OW/OB and WC in women only.
      In contrast, the daily intake of diet soft drinks was associated with higher odds
      of being OW/OB in women and men, but the daily intake of sweets was associated
      with higher odds of WC in women only. In both sexes, having >12 y of education
      was inversely associated with being OW/OB. No associations were observed for
      regular soft-drink intake. CONCLUSIONS: A healthy dietary pattern constituting of
      a daily intake of fruits and vegetables was inversely associated with being OW/OB
      in women. Conversely, a diet soft-drink intake was positively associated with
      being OW/OB in both sexes, probably because of a reduction in overall energy
      intake. More studies are recommended to clarify the effectiveness of diet
      soft-drink consumption in controlling caloric intake and as a healthier
      alternative to regular soft drinks and sweets.

TI  - Experiences of living with type 2 diabetes in Pakistan: the role of culture and
      family in physical activity.
PG  - 103
LID - 10.1186/s12939-022-01706-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetes-related guidelines recommend lifestyle changes for people
      living with type 2 diabetes (PLwD). In South Asian (SA) families, cultural and
      contextual expectations often influence people's decisions. However, broad
      explanations provided in the existing literature and theories concerning family
      involvement can increase the chance of health professionals overlooking the
      complexities of family roles within SA communities. Previous literature has
      identified the need to examine the perspectives of PLwD and their family members 
      in Pakistan to shed light on factors perceived to support and hinder recommended 
      physical activity (PA) to manage type 2 diabetes. This study explored (1) the
      enablers of and barriers to PA in the context of PLwD in Pakistan and (2) family 
      involvement regarding PLwD's engagement with PA. METHODS: Semi-structured
      interviews were conducted with 30 PLwD and 17 family members of PLwD who were
      recruited in metropolitan Lahore (Pakistan) and primarily used state health
      services available to relatively disadvantaged populations. Interviews were
      transcribed and analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Three themes were
      identified: (1) Going for a walk as a feasible PA; (2) the role of family members
      in influencing PA; and (3) gender differences and cultural acceptability of an
      activity. PA enablers for PLwD consist of gender-specific opportunities for
      activity facilitated by peers and family members. Culturally acceptable
      opportunities for PA in Pakistan for specific genders and age groups within the
      socio-cultural context constituted an essential factor. In this study, all women 
      with diabetes described walking as the only acceptable form of PA, whereas some
      men mentioned other activities such as running, playing cricket, and cycling.
      CONCLUSIONS: Medical guidelines must consider patients' daily routines, account
      for cultural and familial expectations of different genders and age groups, and
      address social and physical barriers encountered by these different groups to
      encourage PA among PLwD in SA cultures.

TI  - Influence of diabetes on mortality and ICD therapies in ICD recipients: a
      systematic review and meta-analysis of 162,780 patients.
PG  - 143
LID - 10.1186/s12933-022-01580-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The influence of diabetes on the mortality and risk of implantable
      cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) therapies is still controversial, and a
      comprehensive assessment is lacking. We performed this systematic review and
      meta-analysis to address this controversy. METHODS: We systematically searched
      the PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and Cochrane Library databases to collect
      relevant literature. Fixed and random effects models were used to estimate the
      hazard ratio (HR) with 95% CIs. RESULTS: Thirty-six articles reporting on 162,780
      ICD recipients were included in this analysis. Compared with nondiabetic ICD
      recipients, diabetic ICD recipients had higher all-cause mortality (HR = 1.45,
      95% CI 1.36-1.55). The subgroup analysis showed that secondary prevention
      patients with diabetes may suffer a higher risk of all-cause mortality (HR =
      1.89, 95% CI 1.56-2.28) (for subgroup analysis, P = 0.03). Cardiac mortality was 
      also higher in ICD recipients with diabetes (HR = 1.68, 95% CI 1.35-2.08).
      However, diabetes had no significant effect on the risks of ICD therapies,
      including appropriate or inappropriate therapy, appropriate or inappropriate
      shock and appropriate anti-tachycardia pacing (ATP). Diabetes was associated with
      a decreased risk of inappropriate ATP (HR = 0.56, 95% CI 0.39-0.79). CONCLUSION: 
      Diabetes is associated with an increased risk of mortality in ICD recipients,
      especially in the secondary prevention patients, but does not significantly
      influence the risks of ICD therapies, indicating that the increased mortality of 
      ICD recipients with diabetes may not be caused by arrhythmias. The survival
      benefits of ICD treatment in diabetes patients are limited.

TI  - Honoring the voices of families: An interpretive description of parents'
      understandings of, and insights into preventing type 2 diabetes in adolescents.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The incidence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) in adolescents is increasing, 
      affecting the overall health and quality of life of adolescents and their
      families. Despite the serious health consequences of T2D, few studies have
      explored the role of parents in the prevention of prediabetes and T2D in
      adolescents. Thus, the purpose was to better understand parents' insights into
      strategies needed for the development of interventions to prevent prediabetes and
      T2D in their adolescents and families. METHODS: Thorne's Interpretive Description
      approach was used to guide this second phase of a two-phase study. Using
      purposeful sampling, parents (n = 12) of adolescents at high risk for developing 
      T2D were interviewed. This study was conducted in accordance with the standards
      for reporting qualitative research. RESULTS: Two themes and multiple subthemes
      emerged: Parents' Understanding of T2D (High Blood Sugar, Severe Health Impacts, 
      and Managing Your Diet) and It Takes a Village (The Onus is on the Adolescent,
      Starts at Home with the Parents, We Need More Support, and Getting the Message in
      Their Face). CONCLUSIONS: These qualitative data were insightful as findings
      highlighted the parents' predominant lack of basic knowledge, life skills, and/or
      resources to prevent prediabetes and T2D in adolescents. The results provided
      target areas for education and emphasized the importance of using social media as
      an approach to disseminate important information to adolescents. Parents also
      identified strategies for prevention interventions for adolescents surrounding
      prediabetes and T2D that may be effective. Given the increased prevalence of T2D 
      in adolescents, these results are timely and confirm the urgent need for
      interventions to prevent pediatric prediabetes and T2D. Future research will
      include the co-design, piloting, and evaluation of feasible family-centered
      interventions grounded in participants' experiences and suggestions that are
      reflective of person-centred goals and needs of adolescents.

AB  - The role of metformin (MET) in the treatment of patients with advanced HFrEF and 
      type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) is not firmly established. We studied the impact of
      MET on metabolic profile, quality of life (QoL) and survival in these patients. A
      total of 847 stable patients with advanced HFrEF (57.4 +/- 11.3 years, 67.7% NYHA
      III/IV, LVEF 23.6 +/- 5.8%) underwent clinical and laboratory evaluation and were
      prospectively followed for a median of 1126 (IQRs 410; 1781) days for occurrence 
      of death, urgent heart transplantation or mechanical circulatory support
      implantation. A subgroup of 380 patients (44.9%) had DM, 87 of DM patients
      (22.9%) were treated with MET. Despite worse insulin sensitivity and more severe 
      DM (higher BMI, HbA1c, worse insulin resistance), MET-treated patients exhibited 
      more stable HF marked by lower BNP level (400 vs. 642 ng/l), better LV and RV
      function, lower mitral and tricuspid regurgitation severity, were using smaller
      doses of diuretics (all p < 0.05). Further, they had higher eGFR (69.23 vs. 63.34
      ml/min/1.73 m(2)) and better QoL (MLHFQ: 36 vs. 48 points, p = 0.002). Compared
      to diabetics treated with other glucose-lowering agents, MET-treated patients had
      better event-free survival even after adjustment for BNP, BMI and eGFR (p =
      0.035). Propensity score-matched analysis with 17 covariates yielded 81 pairs of 
      patients and showed a significantly better survival for MET-treated subgroup (p =
      0.01). MET treatment in patients with advanced HFrEF and DM is associated with
      improved outcome by mechanisms beyond the improvement of blood glucose control.

TI  - Thalamic volumetric abnormalities in type 1 diabetes mellitus and 'peripheral'
      neuropathy.
PG  - 13053
LID - 10.1038/s41598-022-16699-x [doi]
AB  - We hypothesized that thalamic volumes of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus
      (DM) and nonpainful diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) would be reduced
      relative to thalamic volumes of patients with type 1 DM and painful DPN. We
      calculated the standardized thalamic volumetric difference between these groups
      in a pilot sample to obtain a statistical power of 80% at a 5% significance
      level. Hence, we measured thalamic volumes from 15 patients with nonpainful DPN
      (10 women, mean age = 49 years, standard deviation [SD] = 11.5) and from 13
      patients with painful DPN (8 women, mean age = 43 years, SD = 12.5) by using a
      manual segmentation approach. A volumetric difference of approximately 15% was
      found between the nonpainful (mean = 5072 mm(3), SD = 528.1) and painful (mean = 
      5976 mm(3), SD = 643.1) DPN groups (P < 0.001). Curiously, a volumetric
      difference between the left (mean = 5198 mm(3), SD = 495.0) and the right (mean =
      4946 mm(3), SD = 590.6) thalamus was also found in patients with nonpainful DPN
      (P < 0.01), but not in patients with painful DPN (P = 0.97). Patients with
      nonpainful DPN have lower thalamic volumes than those with painful DPN,
      especially in the right thalamus.

TI  - Reduced miR-184-3p expression protects pancreatic beta-cells from lipotoxic and

PG  - 340
LID - 10.1038/s41420-022-01142-x [doi]
AB  - The loss of functional beta-cell mass in type 2 diabetes (T2D) is associated with
      molecular events that include beta-cell apoptosis, dysfunction and/or
      dedifferentiation. MicroRNA miR-184-3p has been shown to be involved in several
      beta-cell functions, including insulin secretion, proliferation and survival.
      However, the downstream targets and upstream regulators of miR-184-3p have not
      been fully elucidated. Here, we show reduced miR-184-3p levels in human T2D
      pancreatic islets, whereas its direct target CREB regulated transcription
      coactivator 1 (CRTC1) was increased and protects beta-cells from lipotoxicity-
      and inflammation-induced apoptosis. Downregulation of miR-184-3p in beta-cells
      leads to upregulation of CRTC1 at both the mRNA and protein levels. Remarkably,
      the protective effect of miR-184-3p is dependent on CRTC1, as its silencing in
      human beta-cells abrogates the protective mechanism mediated by inhibition of
      miR-184-3p. Furthermore, in accordance with miR-184-3p downregulation, we also
      found that the beta-cell-specific transcription factor NKX6.1, DNA-binding sites 
      of which are predicted in the promoter sequence of human and mouse MIR184 gene,
      is reduced in human pancreatic T2D islets. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation
      analysis and mRNA silencing experiments, we demonstrated that NKX6.1 directly
      controls both human and murine miR-184 expression. In summary, we provide
      evidence that the decrease in NKX6.1 expression is accompanied by a significant
      reduction in miR-184-3p expression and that reduction of miR-184-3p protects
      beta-cells from apoptosis through a CRTC1-dependent mechanism.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Treatment of cystic fibrosis related diabetes (CFRD) can improve
      outcomes and use of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) can positively impact
      glycemic control. We conducted a systematic review to assess current evidence on 
      CGM compared to self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) in the management of CFRD
      to determine its effect on glycemic, pulmonary, non-pulmonary and quality of life
      outcomes. METHODS: Using pre-defined selection criteria, we searched MEDLINE,
      Embase, CENTRAL, Evidence-Based Medicine Reviews, grey literature and six
      relevant journals for studies using CGM and/or SMBG in CFRD with greater than 6
      weeks of follow-up and reported change in HbA1c. The primary outcome was weighted
      mean difference (WMD) in plasma HbA1c between CGM and SMBG groups. Secondary
      outcomes included exploring interrelationships between CGM metrics and effects on
      disease-specific pulmonary, non-pulmonary and quality of life outcomes. RESULTS: 
      A total of 1671 references were retrieved, 862 studies screened and 124
      full-texts assessed for eligibility. No studies directly compared CGM to SMBG. A 
      meta-analysis of seventeen studies of 416 individuals (CGM = 138, SMBG = 278)
      found CGM group had 4.1 mmol/mol (95% CI -7.9 to -0.30, p = 0.034) lower HbA1c
      compared to SMBG group. Most studies demonstrated moderate-to-high risk of bias. 
      Publication bias was also present. Heterogeneity was high and meta-regression
      identified duration of follow-up in SMBG group as main contributor. CONCLUSION:
      Our findings suggest use of CGM may be associated with improved glycemic control 
      compared to SMBG in CFRD, however evidence of benefit on pulmonary, non-pulmonary
      and psychosocial outcomes are lacking.

TI  - Delivery, maternal and neonatal outcomes in nulliparous women with gestational
      diabetes undergoing epidural labour analgesia: a propensity score-matched
      analysis.
PG  - e060245
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2021-060245 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to retrospectively analyse the influence of epidural 
      labour analgesia (ELA) on delivery and maternal and neonatal outcomes in
      nulliparous women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) using propensity
      score-matched analysis. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort analysis. SETTING: Primary
      care practices in a teaching hospital from March 2018 to October 2021.
      PARTICIPANTS: A total of 816 delivery records of nulliparous women with GDM were 
      collected and retrospectively analysed. INTERVENTIONS: ELA and non-ELA (NELA)
      cohorts were assessed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The primary outcome assessed was
      delivery type (spontaneous, assisted vaginal or caesarean). The secondary
      outcomes assessed included labour duration and maternal and neonatal outcomes.
      RESULTS: A total of 137 propensity score-matched pairs of ELA and NELA patients
      were analysed. ELA was associated with a decreased rate of caesarean section
      (18.3% vs 46.0% in the ELA vs NELA cohort, respectively; p<0.05) and an increased
      occurrence of assisted vaginal delivery (35.8% vs 12.4% in the ELA vs NELA
      cohort, respectively; p<0.05). The duration of the first and total stages of
      labour was prolonged, the occurrence of postpartum fever increased, and the
      duration of hospital stay was shortened in those receiving ELA (all p<0.05).
      Additionally, neonatal birth weight, plasma glucose levels and neonatal
      macrosomia occurrence increased, while neonatal intensive care unit admissions
      and neonatal hypoglycaemia decreased in the ELA versus the NELA group (all
      p<0.05). With respect to other maternal and neonatal outcomes, both cohorts were 
      similar. CONCLUSIONS: The use of ELA decreases the rate of caesarean section and 
      improves maternal and neonatal outcomes in nulliparous women with GDM. TRIAL

      study in China.
PG  - e062239
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2022-062239 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We aimed to assess the associations between night-time sleep duration
      and fasting glucose (FG), triglyceride (TG) to high-density lipoprotein
      cholesterol (HDL-C) ratio and body mass index (BMI) among adults free of type 2
      diabetes (T2D) or without diagnosed T2D. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: 
      Medical examination centres at six hospitals in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region,
      China. PARTICIPANTS: Participants were recruited via multistage, stratified
      cluster sampling. We included adults free of T2D or without diagnosed T2D who
      attended for physical examination and completed the validated questionnaire. 32
      497 participants were included in the study, of whom 52.50% were men. PRIMARY AND
      SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: FG, TG, HDL-C, height and weight were measured.
      RESULTS: Overall, 12.80% and 9.67% reported night sleep duration <7 hours and
      >/=9 hours, respectively; 6.91% had elevated FG and 3.57% had undiagnosed T2D.
      Sleep duration had an independent, U-shaped associated with FG (beta1 (linear
      term)=-0.111, p=0.047; beta2 (quadratic term)=0.008, p=0.026) with 6.9 hours of
      sleep associated with the lowest FG and a negative association with BMI
      (beta=-0.154, p<0.001). BMI mediated a U-shaped association of sleep duration
      with TG/HDL-C (beta1=-0.040, p=0.017; beta2=0.003, p=0.023). CONCLUSIONS: Both
      short and long night-time sleep was associated with elevated FG, and short sleep 
      duration was associated with increased BMI. BMI mediated a U-shaped association
      between sleep duration and TG/HDL-C.

AB  - AIM: We evaluated the associations of age and duration of type 2 diabetes with
      major diabetes-related complications. METHODS: We included 1.1 million people
      with type 2 diabetes from the Australian diabetes registry, followed from 2010 to
      2019. We estimated the incidence of hospitalization or death from myocardial
      infarction (MI), stroke, and heart failure (HF), and hospitalisation for lower
      extremity amputation (LEA); end-stage kidney disease (ESKD; kidney replacement
      therapy or death from ESKD); and all-cause mortality. Poisson regression was used
      to model incidence by attained age, age at diabetes diagnosis, and duration of
      diabetes. RESULTS: Risk for complications increased exponentially with diabetes
      duration. Effects of attained age differed for each complication: age was a
      strong risk factor for MI, stroke, HF, and mortality, while diabetes duration,
      not age, was the predominant determinant of LEA and ESKD. At a given age, a
      10-year longer diabetes duration was associated with a 1.1-1.5-fold increased
      risk of stroke and mortality, a 1.5-2.0-fold increased risk of MI and HF, and a
      2-4-fold increased risk of LEA and ESKD. CONCLUSIONS: Duration of diabetes is a
      stronger risk factor for ESKD and LEA than it is for cardiovascular disease or
      mortality.

AB  - Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists mimic the action of the
      endogenous GLP-1 incretin hormone, improving glycaemic control in type 2 diabetes
      mellitus (T2DM) by increasing insulin secretion and decreasing glucagon secretion
      in a glucose-dependent manner. However, as cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and
      mortality is common in patients with T2DM, several trials with the use of GLP-1
      receptor agonists (RAs) have been performed focusing on endpoints related to
      cardiovascular disease rather than metabolic control of T2DM. Following the
      positive cardiovascular effects of liraglutide, dulaglutide and semaglutide
      observed in these trials, major changes in T2DM management guidelines have
      occurred. This document from a Eastern and Southern European Diabetes Expert
      Group discusses the results of GLP-1 RA CV outcomes trials, their impact on
      recent clinical guidelines for the management of T2DM, and some selected
      combination regimens utilising GLP-1 RAs. We also propose an algorithm for
      guiding GLP-1 RA-based treatment according to patients' characteristics, which
      can be easily applied in every day clinical practice.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To better understand immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-induced
      diabetes mellitus (DM) in cancer patients. DESIGN AND METHOD: We present a case
      of ICI-induced diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and conduct a systematic review of the
      PubMed and Web of Science databases up to September 2021 to identify all
      published cases of ICI-induced diabetes. RESULTS: In addition to our case, a
      total of 171 published cases were identified during the literature search.
      Summary and statistical analyzes were conducted for all 172 cases. The median
      onset time from ICI initiation to DM diagnosis was 12 weeks (range: 0-122). DKA
      was present in 67.4% (116/172) of the cases, and low C-peptide levels were
      detected in 91.8% (123/134), indicating an acute onset of diabetes. Patients with
      positive glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies (GADA) had an earlier onset of
      ICI-induced diabetes (median time 7 weeks vs. 16 weeks for GADA-negative
      patients, p < 0.001) and a higher frequency of DKA development (82.8 vs. 62.1%, p
      = 0.006). All but two patients developed insulin-dependent diabetes permanently. 
      Immunotherapy rechallenge was reported in 53 cases after glycemia was well
      controlled. CONCLUSION: ICI-induced DM is a serious adverse event that often
      presents with life-threatening ketoacidosis. GADA positivity is related to an
      earlier onset of ICI-induced diabetes and a higher frequency of DKA development. 
      Close monitoring of glucose levels is needed in patients receiving ICI treatment.
      ICI-induced DM is usually insulin-dependent since damage to beta cells is
      irreversible. On the premise of well-controlled glycemia, immunotherapy
      rechallenge is feasible.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is the most common metabolic
      complication of pregnancy. The incidence of GDM is increasing worldwide and 5-25%
      of pregnancies are diagnosed with GDM depending on screening strategies and
      diagnostic criteria. GDM may lead to obstetric complications and increases the
      risk of adult metabolic disease in the offspring. Timely identification of GDM
      allows for regulation of maternal glucose levels which may reduce the obstetric
      complications considerably. The aim of this study is to investigate the
      association between second trimester ultrasound biometrics and GDM. STUDY DESIGN:
      This is a retrospective cohort study including 2697 singleton pregnancies
      attending second trimester ultrasound scan at 20 + 0 to 20 + 6 weeks' gestation
      and giving birth at Aalborg University Hospital in the year 2020. Ultrasound
      measurements included head circumference (HC), abdominal circumference (AC),
      femur length (FL) and estimated fetal weight (EFW) by Hadlock's formula. Women
      with pregestational diabetes were excluded. GDM screening was performed on
      indication using oral-glucose-tolerance-test (OGTT) including 75 g glucose and a 
      2-hour serum glucose value >/= 9 mmol/L was considered diagnostic. The
      association between fetal biometrics and GDM was investigated by logistic
      regression. RESULTS: A total of 174 (6.5 %) were diagnosed with GDM. The
      incidence of GDM in pregnancies with biometrics above the 90th centile was; FL:
      10.5 %, HC: 8.8 %, AC: 7.6 %, EFW: 9.3 %. Fetal biometrics above the 90th centile
      was significantly associated with GDM; ORFL = 2.07, p = 0.001; ORHC = 1.89, p =
      0.001; ORAC = 1.63, p = 0.033; OREFW = 1.64, p = 0.036. This association remained
      significant for HC and FL when adjusted for maternal obesity (Body Mass Index >/=
      27): ORHC(adj)=1.56, p = 0.019; ORFL(adj) = 1.57, p = 0.049. CONCLUSION: At the
      second trimester scan, fetal biometrics above the 90th centile increase the risk 
      of GDM. In pregnancies that are later diagnosed with GDM fetal growth is
      increased already at the second trimester scan. Such knowledge underlines the
      importance of early identification of GDM.

AB  - AIMS: To examine the longitudinal association between skeletal muscle mass (SMM) 
      loss and cognitive decline over time in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). METHODS:
      We conducted a prospective cohort study of 453 patients from SMART2D cohort with 
      follow-up intervals of 1.6 to 6.4 years. Baseline and follow-up measurements
      included bio-impedance analysis (BIA) measure of skeletal muscle mass index (SMI)
      and Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS)
      measure of cognitive function. We examined the association between annual rate of
      SMI and RBANS scores using linear regression, adjusting for demographics,
      education, depression, clinical co-variables and presence of apolipoprotein E4
      (APOE) E4 allele. RESULTS: The mean age of participants was 60.3 +/- 7.4 years.
      Compared to patients with Tertile 1 SMI change, the group with greater SMI
      decline (Tertile 3 SMI change) experienced 0.30 decline in RBANS total score
      (95%CI -0.57 to -0.03; p = 0.030) in the adjusted analysis. RBANS scores for
      subdomains in immediate memory and visuo-spatial/construction were lower in
      Tertile 3 SMI change group with corresponding coefficients -0.54 (95%CI -1.01 to 
      -0.06; p = 0.026), and -0.71 (95%CI -1.30 to -0.12; p = 0.019) respectively.
      CONCLUSION: In patients with T2DM, BIA measure of muscle mass loss over time was 
      independently associated with cognitive decline globally and in the domains of
      memory and visuo-spatial/construction.

AB  - AIMS: We aimed to quantify microstructural white matter abnormalities using
      magnetic resonance imaging and examine their associations with 1) brain
      metabolite and volumes and 2) clinical diabetes-specific characteristics and
      complications in adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and distal symmetric
      peripheral neuropathy (DSPN). METHODS: Diffusion tensor images (DTI) obtained
      from 46 adults with T1DM and DSPN and 28 healthy controls were analyzed using
      tract-based spatial statistics and were then associated with 1) brain metabolites
      and volumes and 2) diabetes-specific clinical characteristics (incl. HbA1c,
      diabetes duration, level of retinopathy, nerve conduction assessment). RESULTS:
      Adults with T1DM and DSPN had reduced whole-brain FA skeleton (P = 0.018), most
      prominently in the inferior longitudinal fasciculus and retrolenticular internal 
      capsule (P < 0.001). Reduced fractional anisotropy (FA) was associated with lower
      parietal N-acetylaspartate/creatine metabolite ratio (r = 0.399, P = 0.006),
      brain volumes (P </= 0.002), diabetes duration (r = -0.495, P < 0.001) and sural 
      nerve amplitude (r = 0.296, P = 0.046). Additionally, FA was reduced in the
      subgroup with concomitant proliferative retinopathy compared to non-proliferative
      retinopathy (P = 0.03). No association was observed between FA and HbA1c.
      CONCLUSIONS: This hypothesis-generating study provided that altered white matter 
      microstructural abnormalities in T1DM with DSPN were associated with reduced
      metabolites central for neuronal communications and diabetes complications,
      indicating that peripheral neuropathic complications are often accompanied by
      central neuropathy.

AB  - AIMS: This study examines mortality differences associated with current glycemic 
      status in mortality by current glycemic status among adults with a previously
      diagnosed diabetes. Using previous clinical diagnosis of diabetes (diagnosed
      diabetes) and laboratory measures of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) measured at baseline,
      we estimated mortality differentials simultaneously by diagnosed diabetes and
      baseline glycemic status in the United States. METHODS: Data were from 39,491
      adults aged 30-84 years assessed in the National Health and Nutrition Examination
      Survey (NHANES) III and continuous NHANES 1999-2014 linked to mortality data. We 
      categorized participants into four mutually exclusive groups based on diagnosed
      diabetes and glycemic control measured by HbA1c >/=6.5 % at baseline. Relative
      hazard ratio (HR) of all-cause death among these four groups were estimated using
      Cox proportional models. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in
      mortality by glycemic control status among adults with diagnosed diabetes. The
      same finding was observed among adults without diagnosed diabetes. Adults with
      diagnosed diabetes had higher mortality than adults without diagnosed diabetes
      independent of their baseline glycemic control. CONCLUSIONS: Once diagnosed with 
      diabetes, US adults with normal- and hyper-glycemia showed no significant
      difference in all-cause mortality. This finding emphasizes the importance of
      primary prevention interventions among adults with a sign of early-stage
      diabetes.

TI  - Fasting triglycerides are positively associated with cardiovascular mortality
      risk in people with diabetes.
LID - cvac124 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/cvr/cvac124 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: We investigated the association of fasting triglycerides with
      cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality. METHODS AND RESULTS: This cohort study
      included US adults from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys
      from 1988 to 2014. CVD mortality outcomes were ascertained by linkage to the
      National Death Index records. Cox proportional hazards models were used to
      estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of triglycerides 
      for CVD mortality. The cohort included 26,570 adult participants, among which
      3,978 had diabetes. People with higher triglycerides had a higher prevalence of
      diabetes at baseline. The cohort was followed up for a mean of 12.0 years with
      1,492 CVD deaths recorded. A 1-natural-log-unit higher triglyceride was
      associated with a 30% higher multivariate-adjusted risk of CVD mortality in
      participants with diabetes (HR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.08-1.56) but not in those without
      diabetes (HR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.83-1.07). In participants with diabetes, people
      with high triglycerides (200-499 mg/dL) had a 44% (HR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.12-1.85)
      higher multivariate-adjusted risk of CVD mortality compared with those with
      normal triglycerides (<150 mg/dL). The findings remained significant when
      diabetes was defined by fasting glucose levels alone, or after further adjustment
      for the use of lipid-lowering medications, or after the exclusion of those who
      took lipid-lowering medications. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that
      fasting triglycerides of >/=200 mg/dl are associated with an increased risk of
      CVD mortality in patients with diabetes but not in those without diabetes. Future
      clinical trials of new treatments to lower triglycerides should focus on patients
      with diabetes.

TI  - [Renal effects of GLP-1 agonists in type 2 diabetes].
PG  - 576-590
AB  - The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) is increasing, generating a
      great impact both at individual and public health level. Nearly half of the
      patients with DM2 develop impaired renal function, so nephron-protection is
      highly important. The robust body of evidence that shifted the therapeutic focus 
      from glycemic to cardio-renal metabolic therapy in DM2 led to the inclusion of
      new therapies with cardiovascular and renal benefits in international guidelines.
      Type 1 glucagon (GLP-1) receptor agonists have showed favorable effects on renal 
      function and their potential protective actions are multifactorial, beyond
      glycemic control. These benefits have been demonstrated in efficacy and safety
      clinical studies, as well as in cardiovascular outcomes and real-life studies.
      This comprehensive review describes the direct and indirect effects of these
      molecules, as well as evidence obtained from pivotal clinical (LEADER, SUSTAIN 6 
      and REWIND) and real-life studies demonstrating their beneficial effects on renal
      function, and also introduces expectations of future results from ongoing studies
      with renal endpoints.

TI  - Newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus is a risk factor for cardiocerebrovascular
      events in primary aldosteronism.
LID - 10.1007/s12020-022-03095-8 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the prevalence and clinical significance of newly diagnosed
      diabetes mellitus (DM) in patients with primary aldosteronism (PA). Investigating
      the risk factors for cardiocerebrovascular disease (CCVD) will guide strategies
      for reducing CCVD in patients with PA. METHODS: We retrospectively included 729
      PA patients without DM and conducted oral glucose tolerance tests. RESULTS: We
      found that 15.0% of PA patients had newly diagnosed DM. The DM prevalence
      increased with elevated aldosterone levels [OR = 3.20 (1.77, 5.78), P value <
      0.001]. The rate of CCVD in newly diagnosed diabetic PA patients was higher than 
      that in nondiabetic PA patients at diagnosis (11.9% vs. 5.0%, P = 0.005).
      Furthermore, multivariate logistic analysis revealed that HT duration [1.055
      (1.002,1.111), P = 0.041] and newly diagnosed DM [2.600 (1.072,6.303), P = 0.034]
      were significantly associated with CCVD in PA patients. CONCLUSION: The
      prevalence of newly diagnosed DM in PA patients was higher than that in the
      general population. Aldosterone level was an independent risk factor for DM not
      for CCVD. CCVD was correlated with longer HT duration and newly diagnosed DM.
      Therefore, it is crucial to screen DM at the diagnosis in PA patients.

TI  - Effects of polygenic risk score of type 2 diabetes on the hippocampal topological
      property and episodic memory.
LID - 10.1007/s11682-022-00706-w [doi]
AB  - Type 2 diabetes is associated with a higher risk of dementia. The pathogenesis is
      complex and partly influenced by genetic factors. The hippocampus is the most
      vulnerable brain region in individuals with type 2 diabetes. However, whether the
      genetic risk of type 2 diabetes is associated with the hippocampus and episodic
      memory remains unclear. This study explored the influence of polygenic risk score
      (PRS) of type 2 diabetes on the white matter topological properties of the
      hippocampus among individuals with and without type 2 diabetes and its
      associations with episodic memory. This study included 103 individuals with type 
      2 diabetes and 114 well-matched individuals without type 2 diabetes. All the
      participants were genotyped, and a diffusion tensor imaging-based structural
      network was constructed. PRS was calculated based on a genome-wide association
      study of type 2 diabetes. The PRS-by-disease interactions on the bilateral
      hippocampal topological network properties were evaluated by analysis of
      covariance (ANCOVA). There were significant PRS-by-disease interaction effects on
      the nodal topological properties of the right hippocampus node. In the
      individuals with type 2 diabetes, the PRS was correlated with the right
      hippocampal nodal properties, and the nodal properties were correlated with the
      episodic memory. In addition, the right hippocampal nodal properties mediated the
      effect of PRS on episodic memory in individuals with type 2 diabetes. Our results
      suggested a gene-brain-cognition biological pathway, which might help understand 
      the neural mechanism of the genetic risk of type 2 diabetes affects episodic
      memory in type 2 diabetes.

TI  - Novel Insights into the Pathogenic Impact of Diabetes on the Gastrointestinal
      Tract.
LID - 10.1111/eci.13846 [doi]
AB  - Type 2 and type 1 diabetes are common endocrine disorders with a progressively
      increasing incidence worldwide. These chronic, systemic diseases have multi-organ
      implications, and the whole gastrointestinal (GI) tract represents a frequent
      target in terms of symptom appearance and inter-dependent pathophysiological
      mechanisms. Metabolic alterations linked with diabetic complications, neuropathy 
      and disrupted hormone homeostasis can lead to upper- and/or lower GI symptoms in 
      up to 75% of diabetic patients, with multifactorial involvement of esophagus,
      stomach, upper and lower intestine, and of the gallbladder. On the other hand,
      altered gastrointestinal motility and/or secretions are able to affect glucose
      and lipid homeostasis in the short and long-term. Finally, diabetes has been
      linked with increased cancer risk at different levels of the GI tract. The
      presence of GI symptoms and a comprehensive assessment of GI function should be
      carefully considered in the management of diabetic patients to avoid further
      complications and to ameliorate the quality of life. Additionally, the presence
      of gastrointestinal dysfunction should be adequately managed to improve metabolic
      homeostasis, the efficacy of anti-diabetic treatments, and secondary prevention
      strategies.

TI  - Lessons Learned From a Patient-Centered, Team-Based Intervention for Patients
      With Type 2 Diabetes at High Cardiovascular Risk: Year 1 Results From the CINEMA 
      Program.
PG  - e024482
LID - 10.1161/JAHA.120.024482 [doi]
AB  - Background The care for patients with type 2 diabetes necessitates a
      multidisciplinary team approach to reduce cardiovascular risk, but implementation
      of effective integrated strategies has been limited. Methods and Results We
      conceptualized and initiated a patient-centered, team-based intervention called
      Center for Integrated and Novel Approaches in Vascular-Metabolic Disease (CINEMA)
      at University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center. Patients with type 2 diabetes
      at high risk for cardiovascular events, including those with established
      atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, elevated coronary artery calcium score
      >100, chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, and/or chronic kidney
      disease stages 2 to 4 were included. Herein, we present the year 1 results for
      the program. From May 2020 through August 2021, there were 417 referrals. Among
      206 eligible patients, 113 (55%) completed a baseline and >/=1 follow-up visit
      through December 2021, with mean (SD) time of 105 (34) days between baseline and 
      first follow-up visits. Mean age was 59 years, with 49% women and 37% Black
      patients. Patients had significant reductions from baseline in glycosylated
      hemoglobin (-10.8%), total cholesterol (-7.9%), low-density lipoprotein
      cholesterol (-13.5%), systolic blood pressure (-4.0%), and body mass index
      (-2.7%) (P</=0.001 for all). In addition, among the 129 (63%) eligible patients
      not on sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor or glucagon-like peptide-1
      receptor agonist at baseline, 81% were prescribed evidence-based therapy with
      sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor (n=66 [51%]) and/or glucagon-like
      peptide-1 receptor agonist (n=67 [52%]) to reduce the risk of cardiovascular
      disease in the initial 3-month follow-up period. Conclusions A team-based,
      patient-centered approach to high-risk disease management appears to be a
      promising paradigm for care delivery associated with greater use of
      evidence-based therapies and improved control of multiple cardiovascular risk
      factors.

AB  - Hyperglycemia during the first trimester leads to an increased risk of innate
      malformations as well as death at times close to delivery dates. The methylated
      genes include those from paternal H19 and PEG3 and those from maternal MEST and
      MEG3 that are necessary for the growth and regulation of the human fetus and its 
      placenta. The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the expression of
      these genes in the cord blood of healthy infants born to mothers with gestational
      diabetes mellitus (GDM) and healthy mothers.This case-control study was conducted
      on the cord blood of 40 infants born to mothers with GDM and 35 infants born to
      healthy mothers. Mothers were identified by measuring oral glucose tolerance in
      the 24th-26th week of pregnancy. Cord blood was obtained post-delivery, and cord 
      blood mononuclear cells were immediately extracted, using Ficoll solution. Then, 
      RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis were performed, and gene expression of MEG3,
      PEG3, H19, and MEST was assessed through quantitative real-time PCR.Findings show
      that the expression levels of MEG3, PEG3, H19, and MEST genes were significantly 
      decreased in mononuclear cord blood cells of infants born to mothers with GDM
      when compared to those of the healthy control group.These findings reveal that
      the reduction of imprinted genes in mothers with GDM is most likely due to
      changes in their methylation by an epigenetic process. Considering the importance
      of GDM due to its high prevalence and its side effects both for mother and fetus,
      recognizing their exact mechanisms is of high importance. This has to be studied 
      more widely.

TI  - Diabetes Duration and Subclinical Myocardial Injury: The Atherosclerosis Risk in 
      Communities Study (ARIC).
LID - hvac117 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/clinchem/hvac117 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetes exerts adverse effects on the heart, and a longer diabetes
      duration is associated with greater heart failure risk. We studied diabetes
      duration and subclinical myocardial injury, as reflected by high-sensitivity
      cardiac troponin (hs-cTnT). METHODS: We analyzed 9052 participants without heart 
      failure or coronary heart disease (mean age 63 years, 58% female, 21% Black, 15% 
      with diabetes) at The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study (ARIC) Visit 4
      (1996 to 1998). Diabetes duration was calculated based on diabetes status at
      Visits 1 (1987 to 1989) through 4, or using self-reported age of diabetes
      diagnosis prior to Visit 1. We used multinomial logistic regression to determine 
      the association of diabetes duration with increased (>/=14 ng/L) or detectable
      (>/=6 ng/L) Visit 4 hs-cTnT, relative to undetectable hs-cTnT, adjusted for
      demographics and cardiovascular risk factors. RESULTS: The prevalence of
      increased Visit 4 hs-cTnT was higher in persons with longer diabetes duration,
      from 12% for those with diabetes 0 to <5 years up to 31% among those with
      diabetes for >/=15 years (P for trend <0.0001). New onset diabetes at Visit 4 was
      associated with 1.92x higher relative risk (95% CI, 1.27-2.91) of increased
      hs-cTnT than no diabetes. Longer diabetes duration was associated with greater
      myocardial injury, with duration >/=15 years associated with 9.29x higher risk
      (95% CI, 5.65-15.29) for increased hs-cTnT and 2.07x (95% CI, 1.24-3.16) for
      detectable hs-cTnT, compared to no diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: Longer diabetes
      duration is strongly associated with subclinical myocardial injury.
      Interventional studies are needed to assess whether the prevention and delay of
      diabetes onset can mitigate early myocardial damage.

AB  - Objectives: To evaluate the potential biological involvement of miRNA expression 
      in the immune response and beta cell function in T1D. Methods: We screened 377
      serum miRNAs of 110 subjects divided into four groups: healthy individuals
      (control group) and patients at different stages of T1D progression, from the
      initial immunological manifestation presenting islet autoantibodies (AbP group)
      until partial and strong beta cell damage in the recent (recent T1D group) and
      long-term T1D, with 2 to 5 years of disease (T1D 2-5y group). Results: The
      results revealed 69 differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) in relation to
      controls. Several miRNAs were correlated with islet autoantibodies (IA2A, GADA,
      and Znt8A), age, and C-peptide levels, mainly from AbP, and recent T1D groups
      pointing these miRNAs as relevant to T1D pathogenesis and progression. Several
      miRNAs were related to metabolic derangements, inflammatory pathways, and several
      other autoimmune diseases. Pathway analysis of putative DEM targets revealed an
      enrichment in pathways related to metabolic syndrome, inflammatory response,
      apoptosis and insulin signaling pathways, metabolic derangements, and decreased
      immunomodulation. One of the miRNAs' gene targets was DYRK2 (dual-specificity
      tyrosine-phosphorylation-regulated kinase 2), which is an autoantigen targeted by
      an antibody in T1D. ROC curve analysis showed hsa-miR-16 and hsa-miR-200a-3p with
      AUCs greater than for glucose levels, with discriminating power for T1D
      prediction greater than glucose levels. Conclusions/Interpretation. Our data
      suggests a potential influence of DEMs on disease progression from the initial
      autoimmune lesion up to severe beta cell dysfunction and the role of miRNAs
      hsa-miR-16 and hsa-miR-200a-3p as biomarkers of T1D progression.

TI  - Promoting Physical Activity in Older Adults With Type 2 Diabetes via an
      Anthropomorphic Conversational Agent: Development of an Evidence and Theory-Based
      Multi-Behavior Intervention.
PG  - 883354
LID - 10.3389/fpsyg.2022.883354 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: Anthropomorphic conversational agents (ACA) are a promising digital
      tool to support self-management of type 2 diabetes (T2D), albeit little explored.
      There is a dearth of literature on the detailed content of these interventions,
      which may limit effectiveness and replication. Our aim is to describe the
      development of an evidence and theory-based intervention to improve physical
      activity in older adults with T2D, subsumed in a multi-behavior intervention via 
      a mobile application with an ACA. Methods: Overall decisions on the
      multi-behavior intervention design, such as the use of standardized behavior
      change techniques (BCTTv1), guided the development of the physical activity
      component. Firstly, recommendations on ambulatory activity were used to select
      the target behavior (walking). Meta-research on effective behavior change
      techniques (BCTs) was then identified. One meta-analysis linked effective BCTs
      with the three basic psychological needs of the self-determination theory (SDT). 
      This meta-analysis, taken together with additional evidence on SDT, led to the
      selection of this theory to inform the design. BCTs were extracted from
      meta-research; we selected the most appropriate to be operationalized via the
      conversational agent through multidisciplinary discussions. Rules governing the
      dialogue flow and BCTs tailoring, taking the form "if some conditions hold then
      execute some action," were derived based on the Basic Psychological in Exercise
      Scale (competence, autonomy, and relatedness scores), in conjunction with
      published evidence and multidisciplinary discussions. Results: Thirteen BCTs were
      implemented in the prototype via the ACA (e.g., goal setting behavior 1.1). Six
      if-then rules were derived and depicted in the dialogue steps through process
      flow diagrams, which map how the system functions. An example of a rule is "If
      competence score </= 10 then, apply BCT 1.1 with 500 steps increments as options 
      for the daily walking goal; If competence score > 10 then, apply BCT 1.1 with
      1,000 steps increments as options for the daily walking goal." Conclusion:
      Evidence and SDT were translated into a mobile application prototype using an ACA
      to promote physical activity in older adults with T2D. This approach, which
      includes 13 BCTs and six if-then rules for their tailoring, may leverage the
      efforts of others in developing similar interventions.

TI  - Metformin Protects Cardiovascular Health in People With Diabetes.
PG  - 949113
LID - 10.3389/fcvm.2022.949113 [doi]
AB  - Background: Metformin is the most commonly used drug for patients with diabetes, 
      but there is still some controversy about whether it has a protective effect on
      cardiovascular health. We therefore used the National Health and Nutritional
      Examination Survey (NHANES) database to analyze the impact of metformin use on
      cardiovascular health in patients with diabetes. Methods: We extracted the
      demographic data and laboratory test results of all people with diabetes in the
      NHANES database from January 2017 to March 2020. The outcomes were seven
      indicators of cardiovascular health from the American Heart Association, each was
      scored as 0, 1, and 2 to represent poor, moderate, and ideal health statuses,
      respectively. The scores for the indicators (excluding diet and glycemic status) 
      were summed, and the sum score was then considered to indicate unhealthy (0-5) or
      healthy (>5). Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used, and subgroup
      analyses were performed by age, alcohol consumption, education, and marital
      status. Results: This study included 1,356 patients with diabetes, among which
      606 were taking metformin. After adjusting for all included variables, oral
      metformin in patients with diabetes had a protective effect on the cardiovascular
      health of patients (OR = 0.724, 95% CI = 0.573-0.913, P = 0.007). Subgroup
      analysis indicated that metformin protects the cardiovascular health of people
      with diabetes more clearly in those who are young (OR = 0.655, 95% CI =
      0.481-0.892, P = 0.007), married (OR = 0.633, 95% CI = 0.463-0.863, P = 0.003),
      and drink alcohol (OR = 0.742, 95% CI = 0.581-0.946, P = 0.016). Conclusion: This
      study found that metformin has a protective effect on the cardiovascular health
      of patients with diabetes. The study findings support the general applicability
      of metformin.

AB  - Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the effect of electroacupuncture
      preconditioning on regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO2) levels in elderly
      patients with diabetes. Methods: Forty patients undergoing elective diabetic foot
      surgery were enrolled in this study. All patients were aged 65 years and above
      and weighed 45-75 kg. All were characterized as class II or III according to the 
      American Society of Anesthesiologists' physical status classification system.
      Patients were divided randomly into an electroacupuncture group (group E) and a
      control group (group C); both groups comprised 20 patients. In group E, the DU20 
      (Baihui), DU24 (Shenting), and EX-HN1 (Sishencong) acupoints were selected for
      electroacupuncture 30 min prior to administering anesthesia, while in group C,
      patients underwent routine anesthesia without electroacupuncture. The patients in
      both groups were anesthetized using a sciatic nerve block. The number of cases
      with increased or decreased regional oxygen saturation (rSO2) compared with the
      baseline as well as rSO2 variability in the two groups were recorded and
      compared. Results: There was no significant difference in the preoperative rSO2
      values between the two groups (54.4 +/- 4.8 (L), 53.9 +/- 5.2 (R) [group C] vs
      54.1 +/- 5.2 (L), 54.5 +/- 4.6 (R)[group E]). Compared with group C, the rSO2 in 
      group E increased (50.3 +/- 3.9 [group C] vs 58.4 +/- 3.2[group E]), and this
      difference was statistically significant (P < 0.001). Conclusion:
      Electroacupuncture stimulation can increase rSO2 levels in patients with
      diabetes. Clinical Registration Number: ChiCTR2100048783

      Control Among Qatari Adults With Type 1 Diabetes: Effect of Vaccination Status.
PG  - 914117
LID - 10.3389/fpubh.2022.914117 [doi]
AB  - Objective: To investigate the impact of COVID-19, as an influent barrier on
      physical activity (PA) patterns and glycemic control in Qatari adults with type 1
      diabetes (T1D). As the COVID-19 vaccine may have a potential impact on an
      individual's lifestyle, we also considered this parameter. Methods: Physical
      activity level, the exercise barriers (BAPAD1), anthropometric characteristics,
      the method of insulin administration, and the last glycated hemoglobin in % were 
      completed by 102 Qatari adults with T1D. Moreover, all patients were asked
      whether they had "been vaccinated" or had a "fear of being infected by COVID-19".
      Results: For the unvaccinated group, weight, BMI and HbA1c (%) were significantly
      higher than those of vaccinated group (p < 0.01) and engaged in less
      moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) (p < 0.01) per week and had less time in vigorous 
      PA (VPA) (p < 0.01). A significant association between VPA levels and BMI (beta =
      -0.36, p = 0.02) and HbA1C (%) (beta = -0.22; p = 0.03) was reported, and "being 
      vaccinated" was significantly associated with MVPA (beta = 0.15; p = 0.021) and
      VPA (beta = 0.28; p = 0.032). A higher "Fear of being infected by COVID-19" score
      was negatively correlated with reduced PA profiles (R2 = -0.71 for MVPA; R2 =
      -0.69 for VPA, p < 0.01, respectively). Conclusion: Practicing VPA during the
      COVID-19 pandemic confer many health benefits for Qatari individual with T1D. As 
      the "Fear of being affected by COVID-19" appeared as a potential barrier to PA
      practices this latter e.g. PA, could likely not be achieved without the
      participants being vaccinated.

AB  - Objective: To assess adherence to statin therapy and its association with
      sociodemographic data, medical characteristics, LDLc levels, and LDLc target
      attainment in real-world T2D patients treated in secondary care. Research Design 
      and Methods: Cross-sectional analyses were performed on baseline data of 393
      patients in the DIAbetes and LifEstyle Cohort Twente (DIALECT). The medication
      possession ratio (MPR), calculated with pharmacy dispensing data, was used to
      determine adherence to statins for an intended period of 24 months. Statins were 
      included in the analyses if they were used for at least six consecutive months
      with at least three dispenses. Adherence was defined as an MPR >/=80%.
      Associations with adherence were assessed using descriptive statistics and binary
      logistic regression. Results: Overall, 80% of the patients had a statin
      prescription and of those, 89% were adherent. The proportion of patients who
      reached LDLc targets of </=2.5 mmol/L and <1.8 mmol/L differed significantly
      between the adherent, nonadherent and non-statin group (90% vs. 74% vs. 46%; p < 
      0.01 and 56% vs. 26% vs. 6%; p < 0.01, respectively). Serum LDLc levels were
      lower in the adherent versus the nonadherent and non-statin group (1.76 +/- 0.60 
      vs. 2.23 +/- 0.90 vs. 2.71 +/- 0.67 mmol/L; p < 0.01). Higher HbA1c levels were
      independently associated with nonadherence (OR: 1.05, 95% CI 1.01-1.08; p <
      0.01). Mediation adherence (OR: 2.88, 95% CI 1.04-7.97; p = 0.041) and lower BMI 
      (OR: 0.88, 95% CI 0.81-0.96; p < 0.01) were independently associated with
      attaining the LDLc target of </=2.5 mmol/L. Conclusion: In patients with T2D
      treated in secondary care, statin adherence was relatively high and was
      associated with significantly lower LDLc levels. It is important to identify
      nonadherence as it appeared an important determinant of failure to reach LDLc
      targets. The finding that many patients who failed to attain LDLc targets did not
      receive statin treatment offers an opportunity to improve diabetes care.

      Peptidase-4 Inhibitors in Frail People With Diabetes Who Were Recently
      Hospitalized.
PG  - 886834
LID - 10.3389/fphar.2022.886834 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2Is) reduce heart
      failure (HF) hospitalizations and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in
      general type 2 diabetes populations. The objective of this study was to determine
      whether SGLT-2Is vs. dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4Is) are associated
      with reductions in MACE, HF hospitalizations and mortality in frail people with
      type 2 diabetes. Methods: We conducted a cohort study of all patients aged >/=30 
      years with type 2 diabetes discharged from a hospital in Victoria, Australia
      between January 2014 and March 2018 who received SGLT-2Is or DPP-4Is within 60
      days of discharge. Follow-up commenced 60 days after initial discharge, and MACE,
      HF hospitalization and mortality were recorded. Cox proportional hazards
      regression with competing risks and stabilized inverse probability of treatment
      weights (IPTWs), was used to generate subdistribution hazard ratios (sHRs) with
      95% confidence intervals (CIs). Analyses were stratified into frailty quartiles
      according to Hospital Frailty Risk Scores (HFRS). Results: Of the 32,043
      patients, (41.9% female and 5.9% >/=80 years) in the cohort, 5,152 (16.1%)
      received SGLT-2Is. Overall, SGLT-2I versus DPP-4I recipients had lower rates of
      MACE (sHR 0.51; 95% CI 0.46-0.56), HF hospitalization (sHR 0.42; 95% CI
      0.36-0.49) and mortality (HR 0.38; 95% CI 0.33-0.43). People with HFRSs in the
      fourth quartile who received SGLT-2Is versus DPP-4Is also had reduced rates of
      MACE (sHR 0.37; 95% CI 0.29-0.46), HF hospitalization (sHR 0.43; 95% CI
      0.33-0.56) and mortality (HR 0.32; 95% CI 0.25-0.41). Conclusion: SGLT-2Is may be
      preferred to DPP-4Is for preventing MACE, HF hospitalizations and mortality in
      frail people with type 2 diabetes.

AB  - Pioglitazone (PGZ) is utilized as a therapeutic agent in the management of (type 
      2) diabetes to control blood glucose levels. The existing research work was
      intended to make and optimize PGZ-containing NLCs (nanostructured lipid
      carriers). The fabricated nanostructured lipid carrier preparation was optimized 
      by using different concentrations of the surfactants (Tween 80 and Span 80) and
      solid lipid (Compritol((R)) 888 ATO) and liquid lipid (Labrasol((R))) while
      keeping the concentration of drug (PGZ), and co-surfactants (poloxamer 188) the
      same. The optimized NLC formulation (PGZ-NLCs) was further assessed for physical 
      and chemical characterization, in vitro PGZ release, and stability studies. The
      optimized PGZ-NLCs have shown an average diameter of 150.4 nm, EE of 92.53%, PDI 
      value of 0.076, and zeta-potential of -29.1 mV, correspondingly. The DSC thermal 
      analysis and XRD diffractograms had not presented the spectrum of PGZ, confirming
      the comprehensive encapsulation of PGZ in the lipid core. PGZ-NLCs showed
      significantly extended release (51% in 24 h) compared to the unformulated PGZ.
      Our study findings confirmed that PGZ-NLCs can be a promising drug delivery
      system for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.

PG  - 932086
LID - 10.3389/fmed.2022.932086 [doi]
AB  - Type 1 diabetes (T1D) remains a devastating disease that requires much effort to 
      control. Life-long daily insulin injections or an insulin pump are required to
      avoid severe complications. With many factors contributing to disease onset, T1D 
      is a complex disease to cure. In this review, the risk factors, pathophysiology
      and defect pathways are discussed. Results from (pre)clinical studies are
      highlighted that explore restoration of insulin production and reduction of
      autoimmunity. It has become clear that treatment responsiveness depends on
      certain pathophysiological or genetic characteristics that differ between
      patients. For instance, age at disease manifestation associated with efficacy of 
      immune intervention therapies, such as depleting islet-specific effector T cells 
      or memory B cells and increasing immune regulation. The new challenge is to
      determine in whom to apply which intervention strategy. Within patients with high
      rates of insulitis in early T1D onset, therapy depleting T cells or targeting B
      lymphocytes may have a benefit, whereas slow progressing T1D in adults may be
      better served with more sophisticated, precise and specific disease modifying
      therapies. Genetic barcoding and immune profiling may help determining from which
      new T1D endotypes patients suffer. Furthermore, progressed T1D needs
      replenishment of insulin production besides autoimmunity reversal, as too many
      beta cells are already lost or defect. Recurrent islet autoimmunity and allograft
      rejection or necrosis seem to be the most challenging obstacles. Since beta cells
      are highly immunogenic under stress, treatment might be more effective with
      stress reducing agents such as glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) analogs. Moreover,
      genetic editing by CRISPR-Cas9 allows to create hypoimmunogenic beta cells with
      modified human leukocyte antigen (HLA) expression that secrete immune regulating 
      molecules. Given the differences in T1D between patients, stratification of
      endotypes in clinical trials seems essential for precision medicines and clinical
      decision making.

      Patients With Type 2 Diabetes: a Randomized Control Trial.
PG  - 949762
LID - 10.3389/fendo.2022.949762 [doi]
AB  - This study aimed to investigate the effects of physical therapists' exercise
      instructions in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes. Thirty-six participants
      were recruited from the outpatient clinic at Matsushita Memorial Hospital, Osaka,
      Japan from June 2020 to September 2020 and were randomly assigned to either the
      non-intervention or intervention group. The intervention group received exercise 
      instructions from physical therapists for 30 min at baseline (week 0) and at week
      4 by referring to ambulatory accelerometer records. Laboratory parameters,
      physical activity, body composition, motor skill, and transtheoretical model were
      assessed in both the groups at baseline (week 0) and week 8. In week 8, patients 
      in the intervention group had a statistically significant reduction in HbA1c
      levels compared with those in the non-intervention group (7.3% [6.8-%-7.9%] vs.
      7.4% [7.3%-7.7%], P = 0.04). The number of steps per day (P = 0.001), energy
      expenditure (P = 0.01), lower extremity muscle strength (P = 0.002), and 6-min
      walk test results (P = 0.04) were significantly increased in the intervention
      group compared with those in the non-intervention group in week 8. The
      transtheoretical model varied between baseline (week 0) and week 8 only in the
      intervention group (P < 0.001). Thus, outpatient exercise instructions from
      physical therapists could improve glycemic control owing to physical activity by 
      improving motor skills and changing the transtheoretical model in Japanese
      patients with type 2 diabetes.

TI  - Effects of Exercise Intervention on Type 2 Diabetes Patients With Abdominal
      Obesity and Low Thigh Circumference (EXTEND): Study Protocol for a Randomized
      Controlled Trial.
PG  - 937264
LID - 10.3389/fendo.2022.937264 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: Type 2 diabetes patients have abdominal obesity and low thigh
      circumference. Previous studies have mainly focused on the role of exercise in
      reducing body weight and fat mass, improving glucose and lipid metabolism, with a
      lack of evaluation on the loss of muscle mass, diabetes complications, energy
      metabolism, and brain health. Moreover, whether the potential physiological
      benefit of exercise for diabetes mellitus is related to the modulation of the
      microbiota-gut-brain axis remains unclear. Multi-omics approaches and
      multidimensional evaluations may help systematically and comprehensively
      correlate physical exercise and the metabolic benefits. Methods and Analysis:
      This study is a randomized controlled clinical trial. A total of 100 sedentary
      patients with type 2 diabetes will be allocated to either an exercise or a
      control group in a 1:1 ratio. Participants in the exercise group will receive a
      16-week combined aerobic and resistance exercise training, while those in the
      control group will maintain their sedentary lifestyle unchanged. Additionally,
      all participants will receive a diet administration to control the confounding
      effects of diet. The primary outcome will be the change in body fat mass measured
      using bioelectrical impedance analysis. The secondary outcomes will include body 
      fat mass change rate (%), and changes in anthropometric indicators (body weight, 
      waist, hip, and thigh circumference), clinical biochemical indicators (glycated
      hemoglobin, blood glucose, insulin sensitivity, blood lipid, liver enzyme, and
      renal function), brain health (appetite, mood, and cognitive function),
      immunologic function, metagenomics, metabolomics, energy expenditure,
      cardiopulmonary fitness, exercise-related indicators, fatty liver, cytokines
      (fibroblast growth factor 21, fibroblast growth factor 19, adiponectin, fatty
      acid-binding protein 4, and lipocalin 2), vascular endothelial function,
      autonomic nervous function, and glucose fluctuation. Discussion: This study will 
      evaluate the effect of a 16-week combined aerobic and resistance exercise regimen
      on patients with diabetes. The results will provide a comprehensive evaluation of
      the physiological effects of exercise, and reveal the role of the
      microbiota-gut-brain axis in exercise-induced metabolic benefits to diabetes.

TI  - Safety of Intranasal Insulin in Type 2 Diabetes on Systemic Insulin: A
      Double-Blinded Placebo-Controlled Sub-Study of Memaid Trial.
PG  - 403-415
AB  - Aims: To determine safety of intranasal insulin (INI) in MemAID trial
      participants with diabetes treated with systemic insulins. Materials and Methods:
      This randomized, double-blinded trial consisted of 24-week INI or placebo
      treatment once daily and 24-week follow-up. Safety outcomes were: 1) Short-term
      effects on glycemic variability, hypoglycemic episodes on continuous glucose
      monitoring (CGM) at baseline and on-treatment. 2) Long-term effects on glucose
      metabolism and weight on INI/placebo treatment and post-treatment follow-up. Of
      86 screened subjects, 14 were randomized, 9 (5 INI, 4 Placebo) completed CGM at
      baseline and on-treatment, and 5 (2 INI, 3 Placebo) completed treatment and
      follow-up. Results: INI was safe and was not associated with serious adverse
      events, hypoglycemic episodes or weight gain. INI administration did not acutely 
      affect capillary glucose. Glycemic variability on CGM decreased with INI,
      compared to baseline. On INI treatment, there was a long-term trend toward lower 
      HbA1c, plasma glucose and insulin. No interactions with subcutaneous insulins
      were observed. Conclusions: INI is safe in older people with diabetes treated
      with systemic insulins, and it is not associated with adverse events,
      hypoglycemia or weight gain. Future studies are needed to determine whether INI
      administration can reduce glycemic variability, improve insulin sensitivity and
      thus potentially lessen diabetes burden in this population.

TI  - Evaluation of subclinical atherosclerosis and cardiac functions in children of
      mothers with gestational diabetes and maternal obesity.
PG  - 1-8
LID - 10.1017/S1047951122002402 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: We aimed to evaluate the effects of maternal obesity or
      gestational diabetes on body composition, lipid, and glucose metabolism, arterial
      morphology, and functions in children, and to investigate these effects in terms 
      of cardiometabolic diseases. METHODS: The study group was composed of 48 children
      who had a history of gestational diabetes or maternal obesity, and the control
      group was composed of 33 children. Echocardiographic assessments were performed. 
      Socio-economic status and education level of mothers were obtained. RESULTS: In
      the study group, carotid intima-media thickness, epicardial adipose tissue
      thickness, and arterial stiffness values were found to be significantly higher
      compared to the control group (p < 0.001, p < 0.001, p = 0.003, respectively),
      while arterial distensibility and arterial strain values were found to be
      significantly lower (p = 0.003, p = 0.008, respectively). Among the children who 
      had similar body mass index in both groups, children in the study group had
      higher carotid intima-media thickness and epicardial adipose tissue thickness
      values. Arterial stiffness values were significantly reduced (p = 0.028) and
      arterial distensibility and strain values were significantly increased (p =
      0.039, p = 0.033, respectively) in the children whose mothers had gestational
      diabetes and high socio-economic status. Left ventricular mass and left
      ventricular end-diastolic internal thickness were found to be significantly
      increased in the children who had obese and unemployed mothers (p = 0.04, p =
      0.03, respectively). CONCLUSION: Low socio-economic status was found to be
      associated with increased maternal obesity and gestational diabetes. Poor
      socio-economic status, poor glycaemic control and being overweight during
      pregnancy indicate negative cardiometabolic outcomes for children in the long
      term.

TI  - High human T cell leukaemia virus type 1c proviral loads are associated with
      diabetes and chronic kidney disease: results of a cross-sectional community
      survey in central Australia.
LID - ciac614 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/cid/ciac614 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A link between chronic inflammation and several non-communicable
      diseases (NCD) has been established. Although chronic infection with the human
      T-cell leukaemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is the recognised cause of several
      inflammatory diseases and these are associated with a high number of HTLV-1
      infected cells in peripheral blood (proviral load, PVL), possible interactions
      between PVL and NCDs have not been studied at a community level. METHODS: Adult
      Aboriginal residents of seven remote communities were invited to do a health
      survey between 25 August 2014 and 30 June 2018. Blood was drawn for HTLV-1
      serology and PVL and relevant medical conditions were obtained from health
      records. Associations between HTLV-1 PVL and diabetes, chronic kidney disease
      (CKD), and coronary artery disease (CAD) were determined using logistic
      regression, adjusting for available confounders. RESULTS: Among 510 participants 
      (56% of the estimated adult resident population, 922), 197 (38.6%) were HTLV-1
      infected. A high HTLV-1 PVL was associated with a two-fold increase in the odds
      of diabetes and CKD (diabetes, adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.95 (95% confidence
      interval (CI), 1.06, 3.61, p = 0.033; CKD, aOR 2.00, 95% CI, 1.03, 3.8, p =
      0.041). A non-significant association between high PVL and CAD (aOR, 7.08; 95% CI
      1.00, 50.18; p = 0.05) was found for participants younger than 50 years at the
      time of angiography. CONCLUSION: In a community-based study in central Australia 
      people living with HTLV-1 who had high HTLV-1 PVL were more likely to have
      diabetes and CKD. These findings have potential clinical implications.

TI  - Development and prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with diabetes.
LID - 10.3350/cmh.2022.0095 [doi]
AB  - The incidence of diabetes mellitus and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been
      increasing worldwide during the last few decades, in the context of an increasing
      prevalence of obesity and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Epidemiologic
      studies have revealed that patients with diabetes have a 2- to 3-fold increased
      risk of developing HCC, independent of the severity and cause of the underlying
      liver disease. A bidirectional relationship exists between diabetes and liver
      disease: advanced liver disease promotes the onset of diabetes, and HCC is an
      important cause of death in patients with diabetes; conversely, diabetes is a
      risk factor for liver fibrosis progression and HCC development, and may worsen
      the long-term prognosis of patients with HCC. The existence of close
      interconnections among diabetes, obesity, and NAFLD causes insulin
      resistance-related hyperinsulinemia, increased oxidative stress, and chronic
      inflammation, which are assumed to be the underlying causes of
      hepatocarcinogenesis in patients with diabetes. No appropriate surveillance
      methods for HCC development in patients with diabetes have been established, and 
      liver diseases, including HCC, are often overlooked as complications of diabetes.
      Although some antidiabetic drugs are expected to prevent HCC development, further
      research on the optimal use of antidiabetic drugs aimed at hepatoprotection is
      warranted. Given the increasing medical and socioeconomic impact of diabetes on
      HCC development, diabetologists and hepatologists need to work together to
      develop strategies to address this emerging health issue. This article reviews
      the current knowledge on the impact of diabetes on the development and
      progression of HCC.

TI  - Reprogramming adipose mesenchymal stem cells into islet beta-cells for the
      treatment of canine diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 370
LID - 10.1186/s13287-022-03020-w [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Islet transplantation is an excellent method for the treatment of
      type I diabetes mellitus. However, due to the limited number of donors,
      cumbersome isolation and purification procedures, and immune rejection, the
      clinical application is greatly limited. The development of a simple and
      efficient new method to obtain islet beta-cells is a key problem that urgently
      requires a solution for the treatment of type I diabetes mellitus. METHODS: In
      this study, Pbx1, Rfx3, Pdx1, Ngn3, Pax4 and MafA were used to form a six-gene
      combination to efficiently reprogram aMSCs (adipose mesenchymal stem cells) into 
      ra-betaCs (reprogrammed aMSCs-derived islet beta-cells), and the characteristics 
      and immunogenicity of ra-betaCs were detected. Feasibility of ra-betaCs
      transplantation for the treatment of diabetes mellitus in model dogs and clinical
      dogs was detected. RESULTS: In this study, aMSCs were efficiently reprogrammed
      into ra-betaCs using a six-gene combination. The ra-betaCs showed islet beta-cell
      characteristics. The immunogenicity of ra-betaCs was detected and remained low in
      vitro and increased after transplantation. The cotransplantation of ra-betaCs and
      aMSCs in the treatment of a model and clinical cases of canine diabetes mellitus 
      achieved ideal therapeutic effects. CONCLUSIONS: The aMSCs were efficiently
      reprogrammed into ra-betaCs using a six-gene combination. The cotransplantation
      of ra-betaCs and aMSCs as a treatment for canine diabetes is feasible, which
      provides a theoretical basis and therapeutic method for the treatment of canine
      diabetes.

TI  - Fetoplacental oxygen homeostasis in pregnancies with maternal diabetes mellitus
      and obesity.
LID - 10.1038/s41574-022-00717-z [doi]
AB  - Despite improvements in clinical management, pregnancies complicated by
      pre-existing diabetes mellitus, gestational diabetes mellitus or obesity carry
      substantial risks for parent and offspring. Some of the endocrine and metabolic
      changes in parent and fetus in diabetes mellitus and obesity lead to fetal oxygen
      deficit, mostly due to insulin-induced accelerated fetal metabolism. The human
      fetus deals with reduced oxygenation through a wide range of adaptive responses
      that act at various levels in the placenta as well as the fetus. These responses 
      ensure adequate oxygen delivery to the fetus, increase the oxygen transport
      capacity of fetal blood and redistribute oxygen-rich blood to vital organs such
      as the brain and heart. The liver has a central role in adapting to reduced
      oxygenation by increasing its oxygen extraction and stimulating erythropoietin
      synthesis to increase haematocrit. The type of adaptive response depends on the
      onset and duration of hypoxia and the severity of the metabolic disturbance. In
      pregnancies characterized by diabetes mellitus or obesity, these adaptive systems
      come under additional strain owing to the increased maternal supply of glucose
      and resultant fetal hyperinsulinaemia, both of which stimulate oxidative
      metabolism. In the rare situation that the adaptive responses are overwhelmed,
      stillbirth can ensue.

TI  - Association between new onset type 1 diabetes and real-world antibiotics and
      neonicotinoids' exposure-related gut microbiota perturbation.
LID - 10.1007/s12519-022-00589-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The real-world exposure levels of non-therapeutic antibiotics and
      neonicotinoids in type 1 diabetes (T1D) children and their associations as
      environmental triggers through gut microbiota shifts remained unknown. We thus
      investigated the antibiotics and neonicotinoids' exposure levels and their
      associations with gut microbiota in pediatric T1D. METHODS: Fifty-one newly onset
      T1D children along with 67 age-matched healthy controls were recruited. Urine
      concentrations of 28 antibiotics and 12 neonicotinoids were measured by mass
      spectrometry. Children were grouped according to the kinds of antibiotics' and
      neonicotinoids' exposures, respectively. The 16S rRNA of fecal gut microbiota was
      sequenced, and the correlation with urine antibiotics and neonicotinoids'
      concentrations was analyzed. RESULTS: The overall detection rates of antibiotics 
      were 72.5% and 61.2% among T1D and healthy children, whereas the neonicotinoids
      detection rates were 70.6% and 52.2% (P = 0.044). Children exposed to one kind of
      antibiotic or two or more kinds of neonicotinoids had higher risk of T1D, with
      the odd ratios of 2.579 and 3.911. Furthermore, co-exposure to antibiotics and
      neonicotinoids was associated with T1D, with the odd ratio of 4.924. Antibiotics 
      or neonicotinoids exposure did not affect overall richness and diversity of gut
      microbiota. However, children who were exposed to neither antibiotics nor
      neonicotinoids had higher abundance of Lachnospiraceae than children who were
      exposed to antibiotics and neonicotinoids alone or together. CONCLUSION: High
      antibiotics and neonicotinoids exposures were found in T1D children, and they
      were associated with changes in gut microbiota featured with lower abundance of
      butyrate-producing genera, which might increase the risk of T1D.

TI  - Effect of diabetes on efferocytosis process.
LID - 10.1007/s11033-022-07725-2 [doi]
AB  - Diabetes is a complex of genetic, metabolic, and autoimmune disorders that are
      characterized by hyperglycemia. Elevated apoptotic cell count following defective
      clearance of dead cells that can cause chronic inflammation is a hallmark of the 
      diabetic wound. Effective dead cell clearance is a prerequisite for rapid
      inflammation resolution and successful recovery. Efferocytosis is a multistep
      process in which phagocytes engulf the dead cells. Cell body elimination is of
      great significance in disease and homeostasis. Recent research has clarified that
      diabetic wounds have an enhanced load of the apoptotic cell, which is partly
      attributed to the dysfunction of macrophages in apoptotic clearance at the site
      of the diabetic wounds. In the current work, we highlight the pathways implicated
      in efferocytosis, from the diagnosis of apoptotic cells to the phagocytic
      swallowing and the homeostatic resolution, and explain the possible
      pathophysiological episodes occurring when the proceeding is abrogated. Also, we 
      describe the last development in the management of inflammation in diabetes wound
      and future directions of surveillance.

TI  - Risk of all-cause mortality according to the European Society of Cardiology risk 
      categories in individuals with type 2 diabetes: the Renal Insufficiency And
      Cardiovascular Events (RIACE) Italian Multicenter Study.
LID - 10.1007/s00592-022-01942-8 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: The 2019 and 2021 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) classifications
      stratified patients with type 2 diabetes into three categories according to the
      10-year risk of death from atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). The
      very high-risk category included individuals with established ASCVD, target organ
      damage (TOD), and/or, in the 2019 classification only, >/= 3 additional ASCVD
      risk factors. We assessed risk of all-cause mortality according to the two ESC
      classifications in the Renal Insufficiency And Cardiovascular Events cohort.
      METHODS: Participants (n = 15,773) were stratified based on the presence of
      ASCVD, TOD, and ASCVD risk factors at baseline (2006-2008). Vital status was
      retrieved in 2015. RESULTS: Less than 1% of participants fell in the
      moderate-risk category. According to the 2019 classification, ~ 1/3 fell in the
      high-risk and ~ 2/3 in the very high-risk category, whereas the opposite occurred
      with the 2021 classification. Mortality risk increased across categories
      according to both classifications. Among very high-risk patients, mortality was
      much lower in those with >/= 3 additional ASCVD risk factors and almost equal in 
      those with TOD and ASCVD +/- TOD, using the 2019 classification, whereas it was
      much higher in those with ASCVD + TOD and, to a lesser extent, TOD only than in
      those with ASCVD only, using the 2021 classification. CONCLUSIONS: The negligible
      number of moderate-risk patients suggests that these classifications might
      overestimate risk of ASCVD death. Downgrading patients with >/= 3 additional
      ASCVD risk factors to the high-risk category is consistent with mortality data.
      Risk of death is very high in the presence of TOD irrespective of established
      ASCVD. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00715481.

TI  - Registry-based randomised clinical trials: a remedy for evidence-based diabetes
      care?
LID - 10.1007/s00125-022-05762-x [doi]
AB  - This narrative review describes a new approach to navigation in a challenging
      landscape of clinical drug development in diabetes. Successful outcome studies in
      recent years have led to new indications and guidelines in type 2 diabetes, yet
      the number of clinical trials in diabetes is now declining. This is due to many
      environmental factors acting in concert, including the prioritisation of funding 
      for other diseases, high costs of large randomised clinical trials, increase in
      regulatory requirements and limited entry of novel candidate drugs. There is a
      need for novel and cost-effective paradigms of clinical development to meet these
      and other challenges. The concept of registry-based randomised clinical trials
      (RRCTs) is an attractive option. In this review we focus on type 2 diabetes and
      the prevention of cardiovascular and microvascular comorbidities and mortality,
      using the Swedish SMARTEST trial as an example of an RRCT. We also give some
      examples from other disease areas. The RRCT concept is a novel, cost-effective
      and scientifically sound approach for conducting large-scale diabetes trials in a
      real-world setting.

TI  - Aquatic Aerobic and Combined Training in Management of Type 2 Diabetes: The
      Diabetes and Aquatic Training Study (DATS): A Randomized Clinical Trial.

LID - 10.1123/jpah.2022-0016 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: To compare the effects of aquatic aerobic and combined (aerobic more 
      resistance) training on glycemic control and other cardiometabolic outcomes in
      patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: Patients were randomized to an aquatic
      aerobic training (AERO, n = 19; 57.5 [7.4] y; 9 [47%] women), or an aquatic
      combined training (COMBI, n = 19; 60.9 [7.4] y; 10 [53%] women), or an aquatic
      active procedure control (n = 19; 58.6 [9.7] y; 10 [53%] women) in 3 weekly
      sessions (50 min each), during 15 weeks. Glycated hemoglobin was the primary
      outcome, whereas insulin resistance markers, lipid profile, systemic
      inflammation, renin concentration, blood pressure, physical activity levels, and 
      sitting time were secondary outcomes. RESULTS: Glycated hemoglobin was reduced in
      all groups (P = .021), although changes were more marked in AERO (-0.36%) and
      COMBI (-0.44%) than in active control (-0.26%) group. Lipid profile was similarly
      modified in all groups. Diastolic blood pressure and renin concentration were
      also reduced in all groups; however, renin showed more marked reductions in AERO 
      (-17.7 uIU/mL) and COMBI (-15.1 uIU/mL) than in active control (0.2 uIU/mL)
      group. Fasting insulin, triglycerides, C-reactive protein, systolic blood
      pressure, walking time, and sitting time on weekends were not modified.
      CONCLUSION: AERO and COMBI presented similar effect to improve glycemic control
      and some cardiometabolic risk factors in patients with type 2 diabetes.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the fear of Covid 19 infection among Norwegian patients with 
      type 1 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Fear of Covid 19 scale, a validated
      scale assessing the fear of Covid 19, was sent electronically to 16255 patients
      with type 1 diabetes in May 2021. The items are rated on a scale from 1 to 5
      (total scores from 7 to 35). The higher the score, the greater the fear. RESULTS:
      10145 patients, 52% of the Norwegian adult type 1 diabetes population, completed 
      the questionnaire. The mean total fear score was 13.8 (SD 5.8). Women experienced
      more fear than men (OR 1.96), and fear increased significantly with increasing
      age for both genders (p<0.05). Fear increased with increasing BMI, more
      pronounced for men than women. Fear was positively correlated to HbA1c (Spearman 
      rho 0.067, p<0.05), and significantly increased in patients with micro- and
      macrovascular complications, compared with patients without complications
      (p<0.05). Smokers showed increased fear compared with non-smokers, (1.59
      (1.39-1.81)), and non-European patients reported more fear than Europeans (OR of 
      2.02 (95% CI 1.55-2.63). CONCLUSION: Assessment of fear of Covid 19 in the type 1
      diabetes population in Norway revealed an overall low fear during the third wave 
      of infection. Patients considered to be at high risk of serious disease, such as 
      older individuals, smokers and obese individuals expressed more fear than low
      risk individuals. The degree of fear was also associated with sex, ethnicity,
      educational/working status, glycemic control and presence of complications.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objectives of the study is to investigate the global socioeconomic
      risk factors associated with diabetes prevalence using evidence from available
      country-level data. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study based on (2010 & 2019)
      countrywide Health Nutrition and Population Statistics data. POPULATION: People
      ages 20-79 who have diabetes. SETTING: One hundred and thirty-two countries or
      territories in the world. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE: Diabetes prevalence rates were
      determined from (2010 & 2019) countrywide Health Nutrition and Population
      Statistics (Health Stats, World Bank Group). RESULTS: In 2010, a 1% increase in
      per capita income and total tobacco consumption is associated with a 0.92% (95%
      CI 0.64% to 1.19%) and 0.02% (95% CI 0.006% to 0.047%) increase in diabetes
      prevalence respectively; and a 1% increase in alcohol consumption is associated
      with a -0.85% (95% CI -1.17% to -0.53%) decrease in diabetes prevalence.
      Statistically significant socioeconomic and lifestyle indices positively
      associated with diabetes prevalence included gross national income; overweight
      prevalence (BMI>25 kg/m2); and tobacco consumption. Statistically significant
      inverse associations with global diabetes prevalence included total population
      size; unemployment and alcohol consumption. The 2019 data was removed due to
      sparsity of data. CONCLUSION: Statistically significant global lifestyle and
      socioeconomic determinants of diabetes prevalence include alcohol consumption;
      tobacco consumption; overweight prevalence; per capita income; total population
      and unemployment rates. Determinants of diabetes include modifiable risk factors 
      which are consistent at both the micro and macro level and include tobacco
      consumption and overweight prevalence. Factors which are non-modifiable and
      warrant further investigation include total population and unemployment rates,
      which were inversely associated with diabetes prevalence and are a product of
      other underlying factors. Other determinants such as alcohol consumption was also
      inversely associated with diabetes prevalence, but has been observed to have both
      negative and positive associations with diabetes at the micro-level. These
      associations were dependent upon the amount of alcohol consumed. Global cut-off
      point of alcohol consumption is critical to establish global policies to reduce
      diabetes prevalence. Overall, the use of cross-sectional based study for country 
      level aggregate data is a critical tool that should be considered when making
      global joint strategies or policies against diabetes in both data analysis and
      decision making.

PG  - 1-7
LID - 10.1080/10799893.2022.2102651 [doi]
AB  - Loss-of-function mutations of the arginine vasopressin receptor 2 gene (AVPR2)
      cause Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI). AVPR2 is a kind of G protein coupled 
      receptor (GPCR) and mainly couples with Galphas protein leading to cAMP
      accumulation in the cell as a secondary messenger. Recent studies showed that
      some AVPR2 mutations could cause biased Galphaq/11 protein coupling rather than
      Galphas. Investigation into the characterization of biased receptors may give
      insights into the relationship between the conformational change of the receptor 
      because of the mutation and related downstream signaling. In this study, R68W and
      V162A were analyzed to whether they show a bias to Galphas or Galphaq/11
      proteins. Their functionality in terms of cAMP production via Galphas protein
      coupling was decreased compared to the wild-type receptor. On the other hand,
      they showed the ability to couple with Galphaq/11 protein and make Ca(2+)
      mobilization at different levels in the cell. R68W showed bias to coupling with
      Galphaq/11 protein rather than V162A and wild-type receptor. Studies about the
      Galpha protein coupling bias of mutant AVPR2s may broaden our understanding of
      the relationship between the changed conformation of the receptor and
      consequently activated signaling pathways, and also may shed light on the
      development of more effective new therapeutics.

TI  - Neonatal hypoglycemia in infants born to mothers with gestational diabetes
      mellitus. Comparison of its incidence based on maternal treatment.
PG  - 232-239
LID - 10.5546/aap.2022.eng.232 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Neonatal hypoglycemia is a complication of gestational diabetes
      mellitus. Few studies have been conducted to support a systematic screening in
      the first hours of life of this population group. OBJECTIVE: To assess the
      association between the treatment administered to the mother (diet vs. insulin)
      and the development of hypoglycemia, and to identify associated risk factors.
      MATERIAL AND METHODS: Observational, analytical, and retrospective study carried 
      out at the Buenos Aires and San Justo maternal centers of a general, tertiary
      care hospital between 01-01-2017 and 12-31-2018. The incidence of neonatal
      hypoglycemia (</= 47 mg/dL) based on the management of maternal diabetes was
      estimated and a multivariate analysis was done to assess related factors.
      RESULTS: A total of 195patients were included. No statistical difference was
      found in the incidence of hypoglycemia based on the treatment administered to the
      mother (45.3% vs. 39.7%; p = 0.45) and no associated risk factors were
      identified. Once the cutoff point was changed to </= 40 mg/dL, no differences
      were found in the incidence either (23.4% versus 19%, p = 0.48); however,
      patients with hypoglycemia had a significantly higher hematocrit level and a
      lower prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding upon discharge. Multivariate analysis
      showed an independent association between a high birth weight and hypoglycemia,
      requiring correction. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of neonatal hypoglycemia in the 
      studied population did not vary based on the treatment received by the mother.
      This study supports the control of glycemia in these infants in daily practice.

AB  - Early-onset type 2 diabetes occurring in childhood or early adulthood carries a
      significant excess burden of microvascular diabetes complications, cardiovascular
      disease and premature death, compared to later onset type 2 diabetes along with
      adverse pregnancy outcomes in women of child-bearing age. National audit data in 
      England reveal that 122,780 individuals under the age of 40 years are currently
      living with type 2 diabetes, with an over-representation of people from minority 
      ethnicities and those in the most socioeconomically deprived quintiles. A
      diagnosis of type 2 diabetes earlier in life poses some unique challenges to
      healthcare providers that are not routinely encountered when type 2 diabetes
      presents later. These include; 1) the need to ensure correct diabetes
      classification in an age group that carries a higher probability of other types
      of diabetes, 2) overcoming difficulties in engaging with individuals who are of
      working age or in full time education, 3) appreciating and addressing the lower
      attainment of diabetes treatment targets, and 4) proactively supporting women of 
      child bearing age to optimise their future pregnancy outcomes through better
      preparation for pregnancy, including achieving optimum glycaemic control at the
      time of conception. Meanwhile, approaches to prevent type 2 diabetes in younger
      age groups are challenged by difficulties in identifying those at highest risk,
      by poorer attendance at lifestyle interventions to prevent or delay onset of type
      2 diabetes and by attenuation of associated weight loss in those that do attend. 
      In this article we discuss the importance of recognising and addressing the
      distinct challenges in delivering healthcare to those with early-onset type 2
      diabetes, the greater challenges in preventing type 2 diabetes at younger ages,
      and key components of strategies that might address these challenges to drive
      improvements in pregnancy outcomes, microvascular and cardiovascular outcomes.

TI  - The WISDOM self-management intervention: a cost-effectiveness analysis to support
      the transformation of type 2 diabetes care in England.
PG  - e14928
LID - 10.1111/dme.14928 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the cost-effectiveness of the WISDOM self-management
      intervention for type 2 diabetes compared with care as usual. DESIGN: We
      performed a difference-in-differences analysis to estimate differences in risk
      factors for diabetes complications between people in the WISDOM group (n = 25,
      276) and a control group (n = 15, 272) using GP records. A decision analytic
      model was then used to extrapolate differences in risk factors into costs and
      outcomes in the long-term. SETTING: Participating GP practices in West Hampshire 
      and Southampton, UK. PARTICIPANTS: All people diagnosed with type 2 diabetes
      between January 1990 and March 2020 (n=40,548). OUTCOMES: Diabetes-related
      complications, Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) and costs to the English
      National Health Service at five years and lifetime. INTERVENTIONS: The WISDOM
      intervention included risk stratification, self-management education program to
      professionals and people with type 2 diabetes, and monitoring of key treatment
      targets. RESULTS: WISDOM was associated with less atrial fibrillation [p =
      0.001], albuminuria [p = 0.002] and blood pressure [p = 0.098]. Among all people 
      in the intervention group, WISDOM led to 51 [95%CI: 25; 76] QALYs gained and
      saved pound278,036 [95%CI: -631,900; 176,392] in the first five years after its
      implementation compared with care as usual. During those people' lifetime, WISDOM
      led to 253 [95%CI: 75; 404] QALYs gained and cost saving of pound126,380 [95%CI: 
      -1,466,008; 1,339,628]. The gains in QALYs were a result of reduced
      diabetes-related complications through improved management of the associated risk
      factors. CONCLUSIONS: The WISDOM risk-stratification and education intervention
      for type 2 diabetes appears to be cost-effective compared to usual care by
      reducing diabetes complications.

TI  - Patient-led rapid titration of basal insulin in gestational diabetes is
      associated with improved glycaemic control and lower birthweight.
PG  - e14926
LID - 10.1111/dme.14926 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Elevated fasting blood glucose in gestational diabetes (GDM) is a key
      predictor of high birthweight babies and adverse pregnancy outcomes but is hard
      to treat. We implemented a simple, patient-led, insulin dose titration algorithm 
      aiming to improve fasting glycaemic control in GDM. METHODS: In women with GDM,
      initiating basal insulin, we recommended a daily four-unit dose increase after
      every fasting glucose value >/=5.0mmol/mol (90mg/dL). This approach augmented our
      pre-existing intensive (weekly) specialist nursing input. Using a
      before-and-after retrospective observational study design, we examined insulin
      doses and glucose values at 36 weeks gestation, and maternal and neonatal
      outcomes in 105 women completing pregnancy before and 93 women after the
      intervention. RESULTS: The baseline characteristics of women in the before and
      after groups were the same. Women initiated on insulin after implementation (n=30
      before, n=43 after) achieved substantially higher doses at 36 weeks (53 vs 36
      units/day; 0.56 vs 0.37units/kg/day; p=0.027). 36-week mean fasting glucose was
      lower in those on insulin after implementation (4.6 vs 5.1mmol/L [83 vs 92
      mg/dL]; p=0.031). Birthweight was significantly reduced (birthweight Z-scores
      0.34 vs 0.92; p=0.005). There was no significant difference in macrosomia (after;
      2% vs before; 17% p=0.078) or caesarean sections (after; 33% vs before; 47%;
      p=0.116). No women experienced severe hypoglycaemia. There were no outcome
      differences before vs after intervention in women not treated with insulin.
      CONCLUSIONS: Patient-led daily insulin titration in gestational diabetes leads to
      higher insulin dose use lower fasting glucose and is associated with lower
      birthweight without causing significant hypoglycaemia.

TI  - Diabetes Self-management Apps: Systematic Review of Adoption Determinants and
      Future Research Agenda.
PG  - e28153
LID - 10.2196/28153 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Most diabetes management involves self-management. Effective
      self-management of the condition improves diabetes control, reduces the risk of
      complications, and improves patient outcomes. Mobile apps for diabetes
      self-management (DSM) can enhance patients' self-management activities. However, 
      they are only effective if clinicians recommend them, and patients use them.
      OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the determinants of DSM apps' use by
      patients and their recommendations by health care professionals (HCPs). It also
      outlines the future research agenda for using DSM apps in diabetes care. METHODS:
      We systematically reviewed the factors affecting the adoption of DSM apps by both
      patients and HCPs. Searches were performed using PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL, Cochrane
      Central, ACM, and Xplore digital libraries for articles published from 2008 to
      2020. The search terms were diabetes, mobile apps, and self-management. Relevant 
      data were extracted from the included studies and analyzed using a thematic
      synthesis approach. RESULTS: A total of 28 studies met the inclusion criteria. We
      identified a range of determinants related to patients' and HCPs'
      characteristics, experiences, and preferences. Young female patients were more
      likely to adopt DSM apps. Patients' perceptions of the benefits of apps, ease of 
      use, and recommendations by patients and other HCPs strongly affect their
      intention to use DSM apps. HCPs are less likely to recommend these apps if they
      do not perceive their benefits and may not recommend their use if they are
      unaware of their existence or credibility. Young and technology-savvy HCPs were
      more likely to recommend DSM apps. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the potential of DSM apps
      to improve patients' self-care activities and diabetes outcomes, HCPs and
      patients remain hesitant to use them. However, the COVID-19 pandemic may hasten
      the integration of technology into diabetes care. The use of DSM apps may become 
      a part of the new normal.

      Controlled Trial.
PG  - e37430
LID - 10.2196/37430 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A system that combines technology and web-based coaching can help
      treat chronic conditions such as diabetes. However, the effectiveness of apps in 
      mobile health (mHealth) interventions is inconclusive and unclear due to
      heterogeneous interventions and varying follow-up durations. In addition,
      randomized controlled trial data are limited, and long-term follow-up is lacking,
      especially for apps integrated into electronic medical records. OBJECTIVE: We
      aimed to assess the effect of an electronic medical record-integrated mobile app 
      for personalized diabetes self-care, focusing on the self-monitoring of blood
      glucose and lifestyle modifications, on glycemic control in patients with type 2 
      diabetes mellitus. METHODS: In a 26-week, 3-arm, randomized, controlled,
      open-label, parallel group trial, patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and a
      hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level of >/=7.5% were recruited. The mHealth intervention 
      consisted of self-monitoring of blood glucose with the automatic transfer of
      glucose, diet, and physical activity counseling data (iCareD system).
      Participants were randomly assigned to the following three groups: usual care
      (UC), mobile diabetes self-care (MC), and MC with personalized, bidirectional
      feedback from physicians (MPC). The primary outcome was the change in HbA1c
      levels at 26 weeks. In addition, diabetes-related self-efficacy, self-care
      activities, and satisfaction with the iCareD system were assessed after the
      intervention. RESULTS: A total of 269 participants were enrolled, and 234
      patients (86.9%) remained in the study at 26 weeks. At 12 weeks after the
      intervention, the mean decline in HbA1c levels was significantly different among 
      the 3 groups (UC vs MC vs MPC: -0.49% vs -0.86% vs -1.04%; P=.02). The HbA1c
      level decreased in all groups; however, it did not differ among groups after 26
      weeks. In a subgroup analysis, HbA1c levels showed a statistically significant
      decrease after the intervention in the MPC group compared with the change in the 
      UC or MC group, especially in patients aged <65 years (P=.02), patients with a
      diabetes duration of >/=10 years (P=.02), patients with a BMI of >/=25.0 kg/m(2) 
      (P=.004), patients with a C-peptide level of >/=0.6 ng/mL (P=.008), and patients 
      who did not undergo treatment with insulin (P=.004) at 12 weeks. A total of 87.2%
      (137/157) of the participants were satisfied with the iCareD system. CONCLUSIONS:
      The mHealth intervention for diabetes self-care showed short-term efficacy in
      glycemic control, and the effect decreased over time. The participants were
      comfortable with using the iCareD system and exhibited high adherence. TRIAL

LID - EC-22-0289 [pii]
AB  - AIM: This study aimed to investigate the effects and safety of metformin in
      patients with concurrent diabetes mellitus (DM) and chronic obstructive pulmonary
      disease (COPD). METHODS: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, the China National
      Knowledge, and Cochrane Database were searched to find studies that examined the 
      effects and safety of metformin in patients with concurrent DM and COPD. We
      conducted a meta-analysis with a risk ratio (RR) and assessed the quality of
      included studies and pooled evidence. RESULTS: Eight articles were involved.
      Metformin decreased the risk of COPD-related hospitalizations (RR 0.72, 95% CI
      0.53-0.98; I2=89%) and all-cause mortality (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.36-1.01, I2=69%) in
      patients with concurrent DM and COPD, but didn't increase the risk of
      hyperlactatemia (RR 1.14, 95%CI 0.92-1.41, I2 =8%). CONCLUSIONS: Metformin use in
      patients with concurrent DM and COPD might lower COPD-related hospitalizations
      and the risk of all-cause mortality without increasing the risk of
      hyperlactatemia. Considerations should be given to conduct more high-quality
      randomized trials involving larger samples.

LID - 10.1530/EC-21-0632 [doi]
LID - EC-21-0632 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Subtypes in type 1 diabetes pathogenesis have been implicated based on
      the first appearing autoantibody (primary autoantibody). We set out to describe
      the glucose metabolism in preclinical diabetes in relation to the primary
      autoantibody in children with HLA-conferred disease susceptibility. DESIGN AND
      METHODS: Dysglycemic markers were defined as 10% increase in HbA1c in a 3-12
      months interval or HbA1c >/=5.9% (41mmol/mol) in two consecutive samples,
      impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance, or a random plasma
      glucose value >/=7.8mmol/l. A primary autoantibody could be detected in 295
      children who later developed at least one additional biochemical autoantibody.
      These children were divided into groups: IAA multiple (n=143), GADA multiple
      (n=126) and IA-2A multiple (n=26). Another 229 children seroconverted to
      positivity only for a single biochemical autoantibody and were grouped: IAA only 
      (n=87), GADA only (n=114) and IA-2A only (n=28). RESULTS: No consistent
      differences were observed in selected autoantibody groups during the preclinical 
      period. At diagnosis, children with IAA only showed the highest HbA1c (P<0.001
      between groups) and the highest random plasma glucose (P=0.005 between groups).
      Children with IA-2A only progressed to type 1 diabetes as frequently as those
      with IA-2A multiple (46% vs 54%, P=0.297) whereas those with IAA only or GADA
      only progressed less often than children with IAA multiple or GADA multiple (22% 
      vs 62% (P<0.001) and 7% vs 43% (P<0.001)), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The
      phenotype of preclinical diabetes defined by the primary autoantibody is not
      associated with any discernible differences in glucose metabolism before the
      clinical disease manifestation.

TI  - Smoking, use of smokeless tobacco, HLA genotypes and incidence of latent
      autoimmune diabetes in adults.
LID - 10.1007/s00125-022-05763-w [doi]
AB  - AIMS/HYPOTHESES: Smoking and use of smokeless tobacco (snus) are associated with 
      an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. We investigated whether smoking and snus
      use increase the risk of latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) and
      elucidated potential interaction with HLA high-risk genotypes. METHODS: Analyses 
      were based on Swedish case-control data (collected 2010-2019) with incident cases
      of LADA (n=593) and type 2 diabetes (n=2038), and 3036 controls, and Norwegian
      prospective data (collected 1984-2019) with incident cases of LADA (n=245) and
      type 2 diabetes (n=3726) during 1,696,503 person-years of follow-up. Pooled RRs
      with 95% CIs were estimated for smoking, and ORs for snus use (case-control data 
      only). The interaction was assessed by attributable proportion (AP) due to
      interaction. A two-sample Mendelian randomisation (MR) study on smoking and
      LADA/type 2 diabetes was conducted based on summary statistics from genome-wide
      association studies. RESULTS: Smoking (RRpooled 1.30 [95% CI 1.06, 1.59] for
      current vs never) and snus use (OR 1.97 [95% CI 1.20, 3.24] for >/=15 box-years
      vs never use) were associated with an increased risk of LADA. Corresponding
      estimates for type 2 diabetes were 1.38 (95% CI 1.28, 1.49) and 1.92 (95% CI
      1.27, 2.90), respectively. There was interaction between smoking and HLA
      high-risk genotypes (AP 0.27 [95% CI 0.01, 0.53]) in relation to LADA. The
      positive association between smoking and LADA/type 2 diabetes was confirmed by
      the MR study. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our findings suggest that tobacco use
      increases the risk of LADA and that smoking acts synergistically with genetic
      susceptibility in the promotion of LADA. DATA AVAILABILITY: Analysis codes are
      shared through GitHub (

TI  - Management of cranial diabetes insipidus: clinical outcomes and patient
      perception of care.
PG  - 487-493
LID - 10.1530/EJE-22-0187 [doi]
AB  - Objective: There is growing recognition of morbidity and mortality that can occur
      in patients with cranial diabetes insipidus (CDI) during hospitalisation, due to 
      prescribing errors and dysnatraemia, often related to confusion between CDI and
      diabetes mellitus among non-specialists. We aimed to investigate this. Methods:
      Data for each hospitalisation in patients with CDI attending Oxford University
      Hospital (OUH) were collected retrospectively. The same cohort were invited to
      complete a questionnaire by telephone. Results: One hundred and nine patients
      were included, median age was 42 (range: 6-80) years. Route of desmopressin was
      tablet, melt and nasal spray in 74%, 7% and 17% of patients, respectively, while 
      two patients used a combination of tablet and nasal spray. There were 85
      admissions to OUH by 38 patients between 2012 and 2021. Daily measurement of
      serum sodium was performed in 39% of admissions; hyponatraemia and hypernatraemia
      occurred in 44 and 15% of admissions, respectively. Endocrine consultation was
      sought in 63% of admissions post-2018. Forty-five of 78 patients (58%)
      self-reported >/=1 admission to any hospital since diagnosis. Of these, 53% felt 
      their medical team did not have a good understanding of the management of CDI
      during hospital admission. Twenty-four per cent reported delay in administration 
      of desmopressin, while 44% reported confusion between CDI and diabetes mellitus, 
      often leading to unnecessary blood glucose monitoring. Conclusion: Dysnatraemia
      is common in hospitalised patients with CDI. More than half of patients perceived
      their medical team's understanding of CDI to be poor when admitted with
      intercurrent illness. A coordinated approach, including early consultation of
      specialists, frequent serum sodium monitoring, and education of hospital
      specialists is needed to address this.

AB  - Diabetes is a metabolic disorder owing to the insulin faulty production or the
      resistance to the action mechanism where the accumulation of glucose is the major
      side effect in the body in the case of diabetes. Numerous herbs with the
      potential of reducing glucose production along with combating the secondary
      ailments associated with it but >1% out of 250,000 have been pharmacologically
      validated. Affordability and historical usage of these herbal remedies often
      result in patients' preference as primary or as adjunctive to conventional
      therapies. Clinical trials conducted with herbs are necessary for determining the
      efficacy of the herbs against diabetes. Additional benefits of herbal employment 
      include the treatment of secondary ailments in patients along with diabetes
      including triglyceride reduction, cholesterol level management, body mass index, 
      and cardiovascular disease control. Any individual extract marketed as
      antidiabetic formulations requires clinical validation before adoption but with
      ongoing disease status, quick validation in protocols and testing is needed to
      understand, isolate and cross-verify the status of the bioactive ingredient in
      individual herb and the polyherb extract formulations. Standardization,
      characterization, long-term role and impact on the human body, efficacy status,
      and toxicity profile need to be addressed fully for each active ingredient before
      it is advanced for production. Therefore, after trials, the related regulatory
      bodies will be approached to confirm the safety status and efficacy of the
      prepared concoction.

TI  - Inhibition of CCL28/CCR10-mediated eNOS Downregulation Improves Skin Wound
      Healing in the Obesity-induced Mouse Model of Type 2 Diabetes.
LID - db211108 [pii]
LID - 10.2337/db21-1108 [doi]
AB  - Chronic, non-healing skin wounds such as diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) are common
      in patients with type 2 diabetes. Here, we investigated the role of chemokine
      CCL28 and its receptor CCR10 in downregulation of endothelial nitric oxide
      synthase (eNOS) in association with delayed skin wound healing in the db/db mouse
      model of type 2 diabetes. We observed reduced eNOS expression and elevated
      CCL28/CCR10 levels in dorsal skin of db/db mice and subdermal leg biopsies from
      human subjects with type 2 diabetes. Further interrogation revealed that
      overexpression of CCR10 reduced eNOS expression, NO bioavailability, and tube
      formation of human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMVECs) in vitro
      which was recapitulated in mouse dorsal skin. In addition, incubation of HDMVECs 
      with CCL28 led to internalization of the CCR10/eNOS complex and co-localization
      with lysosome-associated membrane protein-1. Finally, topical application of
      myristoylated CCR10 binding domain 7 amino acid (Myr-CBD7) peptide prevented
      CCR10-eNOS interaction and subsequent eNOS downregulation, enhanced eNOS/NO
      levels, eNOS/VEGF-R2+ microvessel density, and blood perfusion, reduced
      inflammatory cytokine levels, and importantly, decreased wound healing time in
      db/db mice. Thus, endothelial cell CCR10 activation in genetically obese mice
      with type 2 diabetes promotes eNOS depletion and endothelial dysfunction, and
      targeted disruption of CCR10/eNOS interaction improves wound healing.

      for Patients with Type II Diabetes.
LID - 10.2174/1573399819666220721113103 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this systematic review is to discuss the ideal frequency 
      of Registered Dietitian-Nutritionist (RDN) contact required to improve glycemic
      control in patients with type 2 diabetes in the primary care setting. METHODS:
      Researchers completed a literature search between April 1 and June 30, 2020.
      Researchers identified 184 studies and included seven studies for full-text
      analysis. Eligible studies were required to occur in a primary care setting, use 
      A1C as an outcome measure, and use some form of education or contact with an RDN.
      Study quality was assessed using the NIH Study Quality Assessment Tool. RESULTS: 
      Compared with the usual care group of each study, increased contact with an RDN
      improved A1C lowering regardless of frequency (round the clock, monthly,
      biannually). The largest decreases occurred in the round the clock and quarterly 
      touch groups. Studies varied in modality (in-person, telehealth, etc.) and type
      of intervention. The participants had A1Cs between 8.07% to 10.25% before
      intervention. With RDN contact of any frequency between provider visits,
      participants saw A1Cs decrease between 0.66% to 2.2%. CONCLUSION: More frequent
      RDN contact than that recommended by the American Diabetes Association Standards 
      of Care is associated with greater improvements in glycemic control in patients
      with type 2 diabetes in the primary care setting.

TI  - Association of type II diabetes mellitus with characteristics and outcomes for
      patients undergoing sentinel lymph node biopsy for cutaneous melanoma.
LID - 10.1002/jso.27021 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM) can lead to an
      immunosuppressed state, but whether T2DM is associated with worse outcomes for
      patients with melanoma has not been well studied. METHODS: Consecutive patients
      diagnosed with clinical stage I-II cutaneous melanoma who underwent sentinel
      lymph node biopsy at a single institution (2007-2016) were identified. Melanoma
      characteristics and recurrence/survival outcomes were compared between patients
      with and without T2DM at the time of melanoma diagnosis. RESULTS: Of 1128
      patients evaluated, 111 (9.8%) had T2DM (n = 94 [84.7%] non-insulin dependent
      [NID-T2DM]; n = 17 [15.3%] insulin dependent [ID-T2DM]). T2DM patients were more 
      likely to be older (odds ratio [OR] 1.04, p < 0.001), male (OR 2.15, p = 0.003), 
      have tumors >1.0 mm (OR 1.88, p = 0.023), and have microsatellitosis (OR 2.29, p 
      = 0.030). Five-year cumulative incidence of melanoma recurrence was significantly
      higher for patients with ID-T2DM (46.7% ID-T2DM vs. 25.7% NID-T2DM vs. 17.1% no
      T2DM, p < 0.001), and on multivariable analysis, ID-T2DM was independently
      associated with melanoma recurrence (hazard ratio 2.57, p = 0.015). No difference
      in 5-year disease-specific survival was observed between groups. CONCLUSIONS:
      ID-T2DMappears to be associated with more advanced melanoma and increased risk
      for melanoma recurrence. Further study as to whether this reflects differences in
      tumor biology or host factors is warranted.

AB  - PURPOSE: The persistent requirement of self-management for diabetes impacts
      quality of life (QoL), yet the literature for impact of diabetes self-management 
      education and support (DSMES) on QoL in youth has not been synthesized and
      reported. The purpose of this review was to systematically identify and describe 
      the state of the science exploring the impact of DSMES on self-reported QoL in
      youth with type 1 diabetes (T1DM) or type 2 diabetes (T2DM). METHODS: A modified 
      Cochrane review was conducted. Retained studies were published in the English
      language between January 1, 2007, and March 31, 2020. Included studies specified 
      that the intervention had diabetes education addressing at least 1 or more of The
      Association of Diabetes Care & Education Specialists' ADCES7 Self-Care
      Behaviors(TM) (ADCES7) and used an established self-reported QoL measure.
      Retained studies were assessed for risk of bias. RESULTS: Eleven studies reported
      in 12 articles were retained. The interventions were primarily delivered to youth
      with T1DM or T2DM and included caregivers/families in some studies. The ADCES7
      were addressed across the retained studies. Five of the 11 studies assessed QoL
      as the primary outcome and 6 studies as a secondary outcome. CONCLUSION: To
      enhance the QoL outcomes and to provide insight into how to positively impact
      self-perceptions of QoL, ongoing generic and diabetes-specific QoL assessments
      are warranted for youth with T1DM or T2DM. Further research is needed in
      structured DSMES programs to help reduce variability in research designs,
      methods, measures, and outcomes to generate evidence for best practices that can 
      be translated and disseminated into real-world settings.

TI  - Fulminant type 1 diabetes mellitus in a GDM pregnancy: early recognition is vital
      for maternal and fetal outcomes.
LID - 10.1530/EDM-22-0262 [doi]
LID - 22-0262 [pii]
AB  - Summary: Fulminant type 1 diabetes mellitus (FT1DM) is characterised by extremely
      rapid destruction of pancreatic beta cells. An association between FT1DM and
      pregnancy has been reported and can lead to unfavourable pregnancy outcomes
      without timely treatment. We report a case of FT1DM in a pregnancy with
      gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), the first of its kind in the English
      literature to date. A 27-year-old woman with insulin-requiring GDM presented with
      rapidly deteriorating glycaemic control in her third trimester of pregnancy
      despite good concordance to treatment. The investigation identified the hallmarks
      of FT1DM: hyperglycaemia with acute metabolic decompensation and
      non-immune-mediated beta-cell failure. She received prompt treatment with
      intravenous insulin therapy and was transitioned to subcutaneous insulin once
      biochemical improvement had been achieved, albeit with higher insulin
      requirements than before. She had a good pregnancy outcome and delivered a
      healthy male infant 5 weeks later through induction of labour. Due to persistent 
      beta-cell dysfunction, she remained on basal-bolus insulin postpartum. This case 
      highlights the importance of early recognition and treatment of FT1DM in
      pregnancy to prevent adverse maternal and fetal prognoses. Learning points:
      Fulminant type 1 diabetes mellitus (FT1DM) is a subtype of type 1 diabetes
      characterised by extremely rapid beta-cell destruction, leading to abrupt-onset
      hyperglycaemia with ketosis or ketoacidosis. The pathognomonic characteristics of
      FT1DM include the development of diabetic ketosis or ketoacidosis typically
      within 7 days after the onset of symptoms of hyperglycaemia, a near-normal level 
      of glycated haemoglobin despite elevated plasma glucose levels and the absence of
      islet cell autoantibodies. The pathophysiology of FT1DM is unclear but the
      association with genetic predisposition, viral infection and pregnancy has been
      reported. Due to its predilection for pregnancy, clinicians should have a high
      index of suspicion for FT1DM in pregnant women with rapidly progressing
      hyperglycaemic ketoacidosis. As diabetic ketoacidosis in pregnancy is associated 
      with adverse maternal and fetal outcomes, immediate initiation of treatment in
      pregnant women with suspected FT1DM is extremely vital to prevent morbidity and
      mortality, even if investigations are still underway. Patients with FT1DM require
      lifelong insulin therapy due to the complete loss of beta-cell function.

TI  - "Much more convenient, just as effective:" Experiences of starting continuous
      glucose monitoring remotely following Type 1 diabetes diagnosis.
PG  - e14923
LID - 10.1111/dme.14923 [doi]
AB  - AIM: Initiating continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) shortly after Type 1 diabetes
      diagnosis has glycemic and quality of life benefits for youth with Type 1
      diabetes and their families. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic led to a rapid shift to
      virtual delivery of CGM initiation visits. We aimed to understand parents'
      experiences receiving virtual care to initiate CGM within 30 days of diagnosis.
      METHODS: We held focus groups and interviews using a semi-structured interview
      guide with parents of youth who initiated CGM over telehealth within 30 days of
      diagnosis during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Questions aimed to explore experiences 
      of starting CGM virtually. Groups and interviews were audio-recorded,
      transcribed, and analyzed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Participants were 16 
      English-speaking parents (age 43+/-6 years; 63% female) of 15 youth (age 9+/-4
      years; 47% female; 47% non-Hispanic White, 20% Hispanic, 13% Asian, 7% Black, 13%
      other). They described multiple benefits of the virtual visit including
      convenient access to high-quality care; integrating Type 1 diabetes care into
      daily life; and being in the comfort of home. A minority experienced challenges
      with virtual care delivery; most preferred the virtual format. Participants
      expressed that clinics should offer a choice of virtual or in-person to families 
      initiating CGM in the future. CONCLUSION: Most parents appreciated receiving CGM 
      initiation education via telehealth and felt it should be an option offered to
      all families. Further efforts can continue to enhance CGM initiation teaching
      virtually to address identified barriers.

TI  - Comprehensive Diabetes Autoantibody Laboratory-Based Clinical Service Testing in 
      6044 Consecutive Patients: Analysis of Age and Sex Effects.
LID - jfac037 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/jalm/jfac037 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In 2017, Mayo Clinic Laboratories commenced offering a comprehensive 
      type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) autoantibody (Ab) evaluation including 4 known
      Abs targeting glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65), protein tyrosine
      phosphatase-like islet antigen 2 (IA2), insulin (IAA), and zinc transporter 8
      protein (ZnT8) antigens. METHODS: The objective of this study was to evaluate
      real-time data on the frequency and patterns of all 4 Abs stratified by age and
      sex from 6044 unique consecutive adult and pediatric patients undergoing
      evaluation for suspected diabetes. RESULTS: At least one Ab was found in 3370
      (56%) of all samples: 67% of children (aged 0-17), 49% of young adults (aged
      18-35), and 41% for both middle-aged (aged 36-55) and older (aged >55) adults (P 
      </= 0.0001). GAD65-Abs were the most common in all age groups, followed by
      ZnT8-Ab in those <36 years, or IAA-Ab in those >/=36. Frequencies of IA2- and
      ZnT8-Abs drop significantly with increasing age. Clusters of 3 or 4 Abs were more
      frequently encountered in younger patients (41% of children vs 12% in middle- and
      13% in older age groups, P </= 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Children undergoing
      serological evaluation for T1DM were more commonly positive for autoantibodies
      than older age groups. The frequency of ZnT8- and IA2-Abs decreases, and IAA-Ab
      frequency increases with increasing age, and clusters of 2 to 4 autoantibodies
      are more common in children. In clinical practice, comprehensive testing for
      diabetes autoantibodies resulted in a switch in diagnosis to T1DM for patients
      previously classified as type 2 diabetes mellitus.

AB  - Objective: To determine the priority of diabetes prevention and control measures 
      in the perspective of the economy and importance, and provide theoretical support
      for guiding relevant departments to implement measures based on actual economic
      level. Methods: An online survey was conducted on the importance, feasibility and
      implementation of major chronic disease prevention and control measures in 488
      national demonstration areas for comprehensive chronic disease prevention and
      control. The content of the survey was divided into individual and group levels, 
      with 10 dimensions and 44 measures, to obtain the scores of the economy and
      importance. IPA model was used to divide the dimension index of diabetes
      prevention and control into quadrants. The standardized factor load coefficient
      of the second-order confirmatory factor analysis was used to determine the
      priority of dimension index in the same quadrant. The priority of prevention and 
      control measures in each dimension was determined by the discriminant parameter
      of project response theory. Results: The mean scores of economy and importance
      were 66.50 and 89.94, respectively, and the matrix was divided into four
      quadrants. The first quadrant was the "highest priority" with high importance and
      economy, including medical insurance and family doctors, health education,
      high-risk detection and intervention, patient management and community action.
      The second quadrant was characterized as high importance but low economy, which
      was the priority for improvement, including only one dimension of complication
      screening. The third quadrant was the lowest priority due to low importance and
      economy, including personal health service evaluation and follow-up,
      environmental support, diabetes co-infection prevention and glycemic policy. The 
      last quadrant had low importance but high economy, which was the second
      improvement level. The priority measures in different quadrants were: (1) the
      highest priority: blood lipid control, occupational site, prevention and control 
      work plan, blood glucose testing, family doctor contract service; (2) the
      priority improvement: annual neuropathy screening; (3)the lowest priority:
      universal access to risk scoring, healthy eating, healthy dining innovations and 
      tuberculosis screening. Conclusion: IPA model can be used to construct a
      decision-making model for diabetes prevention and control and determine the
      priority of corresponding measures.

TI  - The Association of lncRNA and mRNA Changes in Adipose Tissue with Improved
      Insulin Resistance in Type 2 Obese Diabetes Mellitus Rats after Roux-en-Y Gastric
      Bypass.
PG  - 8902916
LID - 10.1155/2022/8902916 [doi]
AB  - Objective: Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) has shown good effects in improving
      obesity and type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM), but the underlying mechanisms
      remain unclear. This study explored the changes of related lncRNAs, mRNAs, and
      signaling pathways in white adipose tissue of T2DM rats after RYGB based on
      RNA-Seq sequencing, with the aim to provide a theoretical basis for RYGB
      treatment. Methods: T2DM rat models were established by continuous feeding with a
      high-fat diet and injection of streptozotocin (STZ), after which they underwent
      RYGB or sham surgery. After the surgery, their body weight was measured weekly.
      Their fasting blood glucose (FBG) and fasting serum insulin (FSI) were also
      measured. A homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was
      calculated at weeks 0, 8, and 12. Besides, white adipose tissue of T2DM rats was 
      collected for RNA-Seq sequencing and validated by qRT-PCR. A series of
      bioinformatics analyses, such as differential expression genes (DEGs) screening, 
      was performed. GO and KEGG functional enrichment analysis and protein-protein
      interaction (PPI) network construction were conducted based on the sequencing
      data. Results: RYGB surgery could significantly inhibit the weight growth rate
      and decrease the FBG, FSI, and HOMA-IR of T2DM rats. Bioinformatics analysis of
      RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) results revealed that 87 DE- lncRNAs (49 upregulated and
      38 downregulated) and 1,824 DEGs (896 upregulated and 928 downregulated) were
      present in between the RYGB group and Sham group. GO and KEGG analysis showed
      that the target genes of DEGs and differentially expressed lncRNAs (DE-lncRNAs)
      were mainly associated with amino acid metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, channel
      activity, and other processes. In addition, the PPI network diagram also
      displayed that genes such as Fasn, Grin3a, and Nog could be key genes playing a
      role after RYGB. qRT-PCR showed that the expression level of Grin3a in the RYGB
      group was significantly increased compared with the Sham group, while the
      expression of Fasn and Nog was significantly decreased, which was consistent with
      the sequencing results. Conclusion: Using RNA-Seq sequencing, this study revealed
      the changes of related lncRNAs, mRNAs, and signaling pathways in the white
      adipose tissue of T2DM rats after RYGB and identified Fasn, Grin3a, and Nog as
      potential key genes to function after RYGB.

TI  - The Outcomes of Sodium-Glucose Co-transporter 2 Inhibitors (SGLT2I) on
      Diabetes-Associated Neuropathy: A Systematic Review and meta-Analysis.
PG  - 926717
LID - 10.3389/fphar.2022.926717 [doi]
AB  - Diabetes mellitus (DM) is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality
      worldwide. DM patients with diabetic neuropathy (DN) usually present with distal 
      pain, sensorimotor polyneuropathy, postural hypotension, or erectile dysfunction.
      They also may present with other nerve pathologies such as inflammatory
      neuropathies and carpal tunnel syndrome. We conducted a systematic review and
      meta-analysis to assess the benefits of using sodium-glucose co-transporter-2
      inhibitors (SGLT2Is) to manage DN. An extensive systematic literature review was 
      conducted to include all articles published up to 24 February 2022. All clinical 
      studies included patients with DM and reported the outcomes of SGLT2I on
      diabetes-associated neuropathy. Six studies were identified for meta-analysis,
      including a total of 5312 diabetic patients. The average age of the included
      patients ranged from 41 to 74 years and 34-73 years in the SGLT2I treatment and
      control groups, respectively. SGLT2I moderately improved the manifestations of
      diabetic peripheral neuropathy events and nerve conduction velocity. Furthermore,
      the SGLT2I treatment group had a statistically significant higher mean
      heart-to-mediastinum ratio (MD 0.41; 95% 0.17, 0.64; p = 0.0006). However, the
      mean heart rates (MD -4.51; 95% -10.05, 1.04; p = 0.11) and wash out rates (MD
      2.13; 95% -8.48, 12.75; p = 0.69) were not significantly different between the
      two groups. SGLT2Is could therefore be considered neuroprotective in patients
      with DN, possibly by considerably increasing the sensory and motor nerve
      conduction velocity, improving the clinical manifestations of DPN, and reducing
      sympathetic nervous system activity. Systematic Review Registration:

TI  - Effect of Tanshinone IIA on Gut Microbiome in Diabetes-Induced Cognitive
      Impairment.
PG  - 890444
LID - 10.3389/fphar.2022.890444 [doi]
AB  - Diabetes-induced cognitive impairment (DCI) presents a major public health risk
      among the aging population. Previous clinical attempts on known therapeutic
      targets for DCI, such as depleted insulin secretion, insulin resistance, and
      hyperglycaemia have delivered poor patient outcomes. However, recent evidence has
      demonstrated that the gut microbiome plays an important role in DCI by modulating
      cognitive function through the gut-brain crosstalk. The bioactive compound
      tanshinone IIA (TAN) has shown to improve cognitive and memory function in
      diabetes mellitus models, though the pharmacological actions are not fully
      understood. This study aims to investigate the effect and underlying mechanism of
      TAN in attenuating DCI in relation to regulating the gut microbiome. Metagenomic 
      sequencing analyses were performed on a group of control rats, rats with diabetes
      induced by a high-fat/high-glucose diet (HFD) and streptozotocin (STZ) (model
      group) and TAN-treated diabetic rats (TAN group). Cognitive and memory function
      were assessed by the Morris water maze test, histopathological assessment of
      brain tissues, and immunoblotting of neurological biomarkers. The fasting blood
      glucose (FBG) level was monitored throughout the experiments. The levels of serum
      lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) were
      measured by enzyme-linked immunoassays to reflect the circulatory inflammation
      level. The morphology of the colon barrier was observed by histopathological
      staining. Our study confirmed that TAN reduced the FBG level and improved the
      cognitive and memory function against HFD- and STZ-induced diabetes. TAN
      protected the endothelial tight junction in the hippocampus and colon, regulated 
      neuronal biomarkers, and lowered the serum levels of LPS and TNF-alpha. TAN
      corrected the reduced abundance of Bacteroidetes in diabetic rats. At the species
      level, TAN regulated the abundance of B. dorei, Lachnoclostridium sp. YL32 and
      Clostridiodes difficile. TAN modulated the lipid metabolism and biosynthesis of
      fatty acids in related pathways as the main functional components. TAN
      significantly restored the reduced levels of isobutyric acid and butyric acid.
      Our results supported the use of TAN as a promising therapeutic agent for DCI, in
      which the underlying mechanism may be associated with gut microbiome regulation.

TI  - Hepatitis B Virus Infection and Increased Risk of Gestational Diabetes Regardless
      of Liver Function Status: A Xiamen Area Population-Based Study.
PG  - 938149
LID - 10.3389/fphys.2022.938149 [doi]
AB  - Background & Aims: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a significant cause of
      liver function damage. However, previous studies on HBV mainly aimed at ordinary 
      people, and there is a lack of consensus on the relationship between HBV
      infection and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and whether HBV-infected
      pregnant women should undergo antiviral treatment. In addition, systematic
      studies on the impact of HBV infection on GDM have rarely been studied directly. 
      Therefore, the overall goal of this study was to pursue the association between
      HBV infection, liver function, and GDM using Xiamen area gestational big data.
      Methods: Using the Xiamen Primary Health Information System-maternal and child
      health information system, the data on participants (138,867 in total) expected
      confinement between 2008 and 2018 were included. Using univariate and
      multivariate logistic regressions, we constructed models to determine the role of
      HBV infection and liver function status in GDM. In addition, an analysis of
      variance tests was performed to study whether the relationship between HBsAg and 
      GDM differed in the normal liver function and the abnormal liver function
      subgroups. Results: HBsAg's positive status showed a substantial correlation with
      GDM onset in univariate and multivariate logistic regressions (p < 0.001).
      Subgroup analysis among HBsAg, liver function, and GDM suggests that both HBsAg
      and liver function affect the onset of GDM and have the highest prevalence of
      both abnormalities. Furthermore, ANOVA was used to investigate the association of
      HBsAg positive (p < 0.001), abnormal liver function (p < 0.001), and their
      interaction (p = 0.302) on the onset of GDM. This result showed that HBsAg is an 
      independent factor of GDM pathogenesis, regardless of liver function status.
      Conclusion: HBsAg and liver function are independent factors in GDM. Therefore,
      regarding these results, while clinicians consider the traditional risk factors
      of GDM, it is necessary to consider the HBV infection status. Conducting a
      dietary intervention for HBsAg-positive pregnant women at the early stage of
      pregnancy is conducive to reducing the adverse effects.

AB  - Gestational diabetes mellitus is a more common complication in pregnancy and
      rising worldwide and screening for treating gestational diabetes mellitus is an
      opportunity for preventing its complications. Abnormal body mass index is the
      cause of many complications in pregnancy that is one of the major and modifiable 
      risk factors in pregnancy too. This systematic review aimed to define the
      association between body mass index in the first half of pregnancy (before 20
      weeks of gestation) and gestational diabetes mellitus. Web of Science,
      PubMed/Medline, Embase, Scopus, ProQuest, Cochrane library, and Google Scholar
      databases were systematically explored for articles published until April 31,
      2022. Participation, exposure, comparators, outcomes, study design criteria
      include pregnant women (P), body mass index (E), healthy pregnant women (C),
      gestational diabetes mellitus (O), and study design (cohort, case-control, and
      cross-sectional). Newcastle-Ottawa scale checklists were used to report the
      quality of the studies. Eighteen quality studies were analyzed. A total of 41,017
      pregnant women were in the gestational diabetes mellitus group and 285,351
      pregnant women in the normal glucose tolerance group. Studies have reported an
      association between increased body mass index and gestational diabetes mellitus. 
      Women who had a higher body mass index in the first half of pregnancy were at
      higher risk for gestational diabetes mellitus. In the first half of pregnancy,
      body mass index can be used as a reliable and available risk factor to assess
      gestational diabetes mellitus, especially in some situations where the
      pre-pregnancy body mass index is not available.

TI  - Complex Interactions Between Circulating Fatty Acid Levels, Desaturase
      Activities, and the Risk of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus: A Prospective Cohort
      Study.
PG  - 919357
LID - 10.3389/fnut.2022.919357 [doi]
AB  - Objective: Maternal abnormal fatty acid desaturation has previously been linked
      to gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). However, few studies have investigated
      this relationship longitudinally throughout pregnancy. In this study, we
      investigated the relationship between GDM and desaturase activities across the
      pregnancy trimesters. Methods: A total of 661 women (GDM = 189, non-GDM = 472)
      were selected from the Complex Lipids in Mothers and Babies (CLIMB) cohort study.
      Clinical information and maternal serum were collected at 11-14, 22-28, and 32-34
      weeks of gestation. Totally, 20 serum fatty acids were quantified using gas
      chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis at each timepoint.
      Polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) product-to-precursor ratios were used to
      estimate desaturase and elongase activities including delta-5 desaturase, delta-6
      desaturase, stearoyl-CoA desaturase, and elongase. Results: After adjusting for
      major potential confounders including maternal age, BMI, primiparity, smoking,
      and alcohol consumption, we observed a significant increase in the levels of
      gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) and eicosatrienoic acid (DGLA) in the first trimester 
      of women with GDM, whereas GLA and DGLA were reduced in the third trimester, when
      compared to the non-GDM group. Arachidonic acid (AA) showed an upward trend in
      the GDM group throughout pregnancy. Estimated delta-6 desaturase and delta-5
      desaturase activity were elevated in the first trimester (OR = 1.40, 95% CI
      1.03-1.91; OR = 0.56, 95% CI 0.32-0.96) but attenuated in the third trimester (OR
      = 0.78, 95% CI 0.58-1.07; OR = 2.64, 95% CI 1.46-4.78) in GDM pregnancies,
      respective to controls. Estimated delta-9-18 desaturase activity (OR = 3.70, 95% 
      CI 1.49-9.19) was increased in women with GDM in later pregnancy. Conclusions:
      Our study highlights the potential importance of fatty acid desaturase
      activities, particularly estimated delta-5 desaturase and delta-9-18 desaturase
      in the pathophysiology of GDM. These findings may have applications for the early
      diagnosis and management of GDM.

TI  - BMI mediates the association of family medical history with self-reported
      hypertension and diabetes among older adults: Evidence from baseline wave of the 
      longitudinal aging study in India.
PG  - 101175
LID - 10.1016/j.ssmph.2022.101175 [doi]
AB  - Background: This study explored the association between family history of
      hypertension and diabetes with their diagnosis among older Indian adults. The
      study further examined the role of body mass index (BMI) as a potential mediator 
      in these associations. Methods: Data from the Longitudinal Ageing Study in India 
      (LASI, 2017-18), wave-1 were used. The sample for the study included 31,464 older
      adults aged 60 years and above. Descriptive statistics and bivariate analysis has
      been conducted to assess the prevalence of self-reported hypertension and
      diabetes. Further, multivariable logistic regression models were used to test the
      research hypotheses of this study. The Karlson-Holm-Breen (KHB) mediation
      analysis was conducted to recover the direct and indirect effects of BMI in the
      association of family medical history and diagnosis of hypertension and diabetes.
      Results: A proportion of 32.70% of older adults were diagnosed with hypertension 
      and 14.23% of older adults were diagnosed with diabetes. A proportion of 19.48%
      and 14.69% of older adults had a family history of hypertension and diabetes,
      respectively. Also, 16.57% and 5.53% of older adults were overweight and obese,
      respectively in the current study. Older adults who had family history of
      hypertension had higher odds of being diagnosed with hypertension [aOR: 2.23, CI:
      2.07-2.39] than those who had no such family history. This association was
      mediated by BMI (percent mediated: 6.31%). Similarly, older adults who had family
      history of diabetes had higher odds of being diagnosed with diabetes [aOR: 2.63, 
      CI: 2.41-2.88] than those who had no such family history. This association was
      mediated by BMI (percent effect mediated: 6.66%). Conclusion: The study
      highlights the relevance of using family medical history data along with
      information on BMI as potential source for the control and management of
      hypertension and diabetes among older population.

LID - 10.1155/2022/2423333 [doi]
AB  - Objective: This study was aimed at investigating the correlation of platelet
      function with postpartum hemorrhage and venous thromboembolism (VTE) in
      gestational hypertension patients with diabetes mellitus. Methods: A total of 93 
      patients with gestational hypertension complicated with diabetes treated from
      March 2020 to June 2021 were selected as the research group, and 56 healthy
      pregnant women during the same period were selected as the control group.
      Platelet function-related indicators (platelet count (PLT), platelet volume
      distribution width (PDW), and mean platelet volume (MPV)) were compared between
      the two groups. The patients were divided into a severe group (n = 13), mild
      group (n = 28), and nonbleeding group (n = 52) according to the severity of
      postpartum hemorrhage, and the value of combined detection of platelet
      function-related indicators on the severity of postpartum hemorrhage was
      evaluated and analyzed. According to the occurrence of VTE, the patients were
      divided into a VTE group and non-VTE group to analyze the predictive value of
      combined detection of platelet function-related indicators for VTE occurrence in 
      patients. Results: The PLT value of the study group was lower than that of the
      control group, while the PDW and MPV values were higher than those of the control
      group (all P < 0.05). The PLT value increased with the aggravation of postpartum 
      hemorrhage, while the PDW and MPV values decreased with the aggravation of
      postpartum hemorrhage among the three groups with different severities of
      postpartum hemorrhage (all P < 0.05). The area under the curve (AUC) of PLT, PDW,
      and MPV combination to evaluate the severity of postpartum hemorrhage in patients
      with gestational hypertension combined with diabetes was greater than that of PLT
      alone and PDW alone (both P < 0.05). The PLT value was negatively correlated with
      the severity of postpartum hemorrhage, while PDW and MPV values were positively
      correlated with the severity of postpartum hemorrhage (both P < 0.05). According 
      to the occurrence of VTE, patients were divided into the VTE group (n = 10) and
      non-VTE group (n = 83). The PLT value of the VTE group was higher than that of
      the non-VTE group, while the PDW and MPV values were lower than those of the
      non-VTE group (all P < 0.05). The AUC of PLT, PDW, and MPV combination to predict
      the occurrence of VTE in patients with gestational hypertension combined with
      diabetes was greater than that of each index alone (all P < 0.05). Conclusion:
      Patients with gestational hypertension complicated with diabetes had abnormal
      platelet function, and the platelet function was related to postpartum hemorrhage
      and VTE.

TI  - Diabetic Foot Risk Classification at the Time of Type 2 Diabetes Diagnosis and
      Subsequent Risk of Mortality: A Population-Based Cohort Study.
PG  - 888924

AB  - Aim: We aimed to compare the mortality of individuals at low, moderate, and high 
      risk of diabetic foot disease (DFD) in the context of newly diagnosed type 2
      diabetes, before developing active diabetic foot problem. Methods: This was a
      population-based cohort study of adults with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes
      utilizing IQVIA Medical Research Data. The outcome was all-cause mortality among 
      individuals with low, moderate, and high risk of DFD, and also in those with no
      record of foot assessment and those who declined foot examination. Results: Of
      225,787 individuals with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes, 34,061 (15.1%) died
      during the study period from January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2019. Moderate risk 
      and high risk of DFD were associated with increased mortality risk compared to
      low risk of DFD (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.50, 95% CI 1.42, 1.58; aHR 2.01,
      95% CI 1.84, 2.20, respectively). Individuals who declined foot examination or
      who had no record also had increased mortality risk of 75% and 25% vs. those at
      low risk of DFD, respectively (aHR 1.75, 95% CI 1.51, 2.04; aHR 1.25, 95% CI
      1.20, 1.30). Conclusion: Individuals with new-onset type 2 diabetes who had
      moderate to high risk of DFD were more likely to die compared to those at low
      risk of DFD. The associations between declined foot examination and absence of
      foot examinations, and increased risk of mortality further highlight the
      importance of assessing foot risk as it identifies not only patients at risk of
      diabetic foot ulceration but also mortality.

AB  - Background: With the development of economy, the living standard of people all
      over the world has been greatly improved, and the incidence of diabetes is also
      increasing. Many people with diabetes also develop other complications that
      reduce their quality of life. Diabetic nephropathy is a common complication of
      type2 diabetes. Understanding the related factors of diabetic nephropathy is
      greatly significant to control the occurrence of diabetic nephropathy and improve
      patient's life quality. Data and Methods: Data were collected from 2009 to 2018
      in NHANES. Curve fitting graph was performed to investigate the association
      between globulin (GLB) and diabetic nephropathy(DN). Four logistic regression
      models were conducted to control the potential confounding factors. Subgroup
      analysis was carried out to assess the stability of results. Results: GLB was
      positively correlated with the occurrence of DN after controlling for potential
      confounders. Higher GLB was associated with an increased risk of diabetic
      nephropathy [odds ratio(OR), 1.10; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.07-1.13, P <
      0.001]. Conclusions: In this cross-sectional study, GLB was significant
      positively correlated with the occurrence of DN in patients with type2 diabetes
      mellitus.

PG  - 905538
LID - 10.3389/fendo.2022.905538 [doi]
AB  - Background: We aimed to examine the descriptive epidemiology and trends in the
      burden of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Methods: Data were extracted from the 
      Global Burden of Disease 2019 dataset. Estimated annual percentage changes
      (EAPCs) were calculated to assess the trends in incidence rate, mortality and
      disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) associated with T2DM. Measures were
      stratified by sex, region, country, age and social development index (SDI) value.
      Results: The global age-standardized incidence rate of T2DM increased from 1990
      to 2019, with an EAPC of 1.25 (95% CI, 1.19 to 1.31). In 2019, the highest
      age-standardized incidence rate of T2DM was observed in high-SDI regions, and the
      largest increase in this rate from 1990 to 2019 was also in high-SDI regions
      (EAPC, 1.74;95% CI, 1.57 to 1.90). At the regional level, Central Asia (EAPC,
      2.53;95% CI, 2.45 to 2.61) had the largest increase in the age-standardized
      incidence rate of T2DM from 1990 to 2019. At the national level, Luxembourg
      (EAPC, 4.51;95% CI, 4.37 to 4.65) and Uzbekistan (EAPC, 3.63; 95% CI, 3.44 to
      3.82) had the largest increases in the age-standardized incidence rate of T2DM
      from 1990 to 2019. The global age-standardized death and DALY rates increased
      from 1990 to 2019, with EAPCs of 0.26 (95% CI, 0.16 to 0.37) and 0.81 (95% CI,
      0.77 to 0.85), respectively. The age-standardized death and DALY rates showed the
      largest increases in Central Asia, South Asia and Southern Sub-Saharan Africa.
      Conclusions: Globally, the age-standardized incidence, death and DALY rates
      increased from 1990 to 2019. Central Asia, South Asia and Southern Sub-Saharan
      Africa were found to have the greatest burden of T2DM. Future strategies should
      focus on these high-risk regions and other high-risk populations.

PG  - 790619
LID - 10.3389/fendo.2022.790619 [doi]
AB  - Background: Heart failure (HF) and diabetes mellitus (DM) are life-threatening
      diseases. However, existing clinical drugs to treat HF complicated with DM are
      relatively limited. In this study, we performed a viable bioinformatics strategy 
      combining network pharmacology and molecular docking to identify potential
      anti-HF and -DM targets and therapeutic mechanisms of calycosin, a functional
      phytoestrogen. Methods: Web-based databases were used to collect candidate
      genes/targets of calycosin and HF/DM and then identify the hub bio-targets of
      calycosin against HF/DM. Using the online-available database, all functional
      processes and signaling pathways of calycosin against HF/DM were screened and
      identified before further visualization. Results: All potential bio-targets of
      calycosin and HF/DM were collected, and 20 hub targets of calycosin against HF/DM
      were identified. Interestingly, molecular docking findings indicated that
      mitogen-activated protein kinase-1 (MAPK1), beta-arrestin 1 (ARRB1), and
      homologue-1 (ABL1) may be potent pharmacological targets of calycosin against
      HF/DM. In addition, all primary molecular functions of calycosin against HF/DM
      were identified, including regulating protein binding, ubiquitination, and the
      metabolic process. Furthermore, the top molecular pathways of calycosin against
      HF/DM were revealed, including cardiomyocyte and chemokine signaling pathways.
      Conclusion: Our bioinformatics analysis uncovered the network targets and
      therapeutic mechanisms of calycosin against HF/DM. For the first time, the
      current in silico findings revealed that the identified hub targets may be used
      to screen and treat HF/DM.

TI  - Investigating the Effects of Diet-Induced Pre-Diabetes on the Functioning of
      Calcium-Regulating Organs in Male Sprague Dawley Rats: Effects on Selected
      Markers.
PG  - 914189
LID - 10.3389/fendo.2022.914189 [doi]
AB  - Derangements to the functioning of calcium-regulating organs have been associated
      with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), a condition preceded by pre-diabetes. Type 
      2 diabetes has shown to promote renal calcium wastage, intestinal calcium
      malabsorption and increased bone resorption. However, the changes to the
      functioning of calcium-regulating organs in pre-diabetes are not known.
      Subsequently, the effects of diet-induced pre-diabetes on the functioning of
      calcium-regulating organs in a rat model for pre-diabetes was investigated in
      this study. Male Sprague Dawley rats were separated into two groups (n=6, each
      group): non-pre-diabetic (NPD) group and a diet-induced pre-diabetic (DIPD) group
      for 20 weeks. After the experimental period, postprandial glucose and HOMA-IR
      were analysed in addition to plasma and urinary calcium concentrations. Gene
      expressions of intestinal vitamin D (VDR), intestinal calbindin-D9k, renal
      1-alpha hydroxylase and renal transient receptor potential vanilloid 5 (TRPV5)
      expressions in addition to plasma osteocalcin and urinary deoxypyridinoline
      concentrations were analysed at week 20. The results demonstrated significantly
      increased concentrations of postprandial glucose, HOMA-IR and urinary calcium in 
      addition to unchanged plasma calcium levels in the DIPD group by comparison to
      NPD. Renal TRPV5, renal 1-alpha hydroxylase, intestinal VDR and intestinal
      calbindin-D9k expressions were increased in the DIPD group by comparison to NPD. 
      Furthermore, plasma osteocalcin levels were increased and urine deoxypyridinoline
      levels were decreased in the DIPD group by comparison to NPD. These observations 
      may suggest that calcium-regulating organs compensate for the changes to calcium 
      homeostasis by inducing increased renal calcium reabsorption, increased
      intestinal calcium absorption and decreased bone resorption followed by increased
      bone formation.

TI  - Poor Self-Care Practices and Being Urban Resident Strongly Predict Chronic
      Complications Among Patients with Type 2 Diabetes in Eastern Ethiopia: A
      Hospital-Based Cross-Sectional Study.
PG  - 2095-2106
LID - 10.2147/DMSO.S368165 [doi]
AB  - Background: Diabetes, together with its complications, has a considerable
      negative influence on people's quality of life and healthcare delivery and raises
      diabetic mortality. However, there is limited information about the
      diabetes-associated chronic complications in the study setting. Therefore, this
      study aimed to determine the burden and factors related to the chronic
      complications among patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) in Eastern Ethiopia.
      Methods: A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 879 patients 
      with T2D at two public hospitals in Harar. The data were collected through
      interviews using a structured questionnaire. Data related to the diagnosis of
      chronic complications and biochemical tests were extracted from medical records. 
      The outcome variable was the number of chronic complications that happened to the
      patients. A generalized Poisson regression model with robust variance estimation 
      was used to investigate the association of independent variables with chronic
      complications. An adjusted prevalence ratio with a 95% CI was reported to show an
      association using a p-value </=0.05. Results: One or more chronic complications
      were presented in 43% of T2D (95% CI: 39.65, 46.19). Macrovascular and
      microvascular complications were found in 27.6% and 23.5% of patients,
      respectively. Urban residence (APR = 2.64; 95% CI: 1.54, 4.54), low wealth status
      (APR = 1.80; 95% CI: 1.17, 2.76), diabetes duration >/=5 years (APR = 1.46; 95%
      CI: 1.05, 2.01), hypertriglyceridemia (APR = 1.48; 95% CI: 1.07, 2.09) and poor
      self-care practices (APR = 1.62; 95% CI: 1.18, 2.23) were factors significantly
      associated with the chronic complications. Conclusion: The burden of chronic
      complications was high, with nearly half of T2D patients experiencing one or more
      chronic complications. Almost one in ten patients suffered from multiple chronic 
      complications. The complications were mainly influenced by being urban resident, 
      low wealth status, and poor self-care practices. Therefore, health care providers
      need to educate patients and promote self-care practices and healthy lifestyles
      to achieve treatment goals and lower the risk of chronic complications.

      Brain Regions of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients.
PG  - 904468

AB  - To investigate the alteration of cerebral blood flow (CBF) and its connectivity
      patterns in olfactory-related regions of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients
      using arterial spin labeling (ASL). Sixty-nine patients with T2DM and 63 healthy 
      controls (HCs) underwent ASL scanning using 3.0T magnetic resonance imaging. We
      compared the CBF values of the olfactory-related brain regions between the two
      groups and analyzed the correlation between their changes and clinical variables.
      We also used these regions as seeds to explore the differences in CBF
      connectivity patterns in olfactory-related brain regions between the T2DM
      patients and HCs. Compared with the HC group, the CBF of the right orbital part
      of the inferior frontal gyrus (OIFG), right insula, and bilateral olfactory
      cortex was decreased in the T2DM patients. Moreover, the duration of the patients
      was negatively correlated with the CBF changes in the right OIFG, right insula,
      and right olfactory cortex. The CBF changes in the right OIFG were positively
      correlated with the Self-Rating Depression Scale scores, those in the right
      insula were negatively correlated with the max blood glucose of continuous
      glucose, and those in the right olfactory cortex were negatively correlated with 
      the mean blood glucose of continuous glucose. In addition, the T2DM patients also
      showed decreased CBF connectivity between the right OIFG and the left temporal
      pole of the middle temporal gyrus and increased CBF connectivity between the
      right medial orbital part of the superior frontal gyrus and the right orbital
      part of the superior frontal gyrus and between the right olfactory cortex and the
      bilateral caudate and the left putamen. Patients with T2DM have decreased CBF and
      altered CBF connectivity in multiple olfactory-related brain regions. These
      changes may help explain why olfactory dysfunction occurs in patients with T2DM, 
      thus providing insights into the neuropathological mechanism of olfactory
      dysfunction and cognitive decline in T2DM patients.

TI  - The Role of Type 2 Diabetes in Pancreatic Cancer.
PG  - e26288
LID - 10.7759/cureus.26288 [doi]
AB  - The incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and its potential complications,
      such as cancers, are increasing worldwide at an astounding rate. There are many
      factors such as obesity, diabetes, alcohol consumption, and the adoption of
      sedentary lifestyles that are driving pancreatic cancer (PC) to become one of the
      leading causes of cancer mortality in the United States. PC is notorious for its 
      generic symptoms and late-stage presentation with rapid metastasis. The
      connection between T2DM and the risk of PC development is multifaceted and
      complex. Some of the proposed theories reveal that chronic inflammation, insulin 
      resistance, hyperinsulinemia, hyperglycemia, and abnormalities in the insulin and
      insulin-like growth factor axis (IGF) contribute to the disease association
      between these two conditions. This literature review aims to highlight relevant
      studies and explore the molecular mechanisms involved in the etiology of diabetes
      and its impact on PC development, as well as the role of anti-diabetic agents on 
      PC. Despite extensive studies, the exact interaction between T2DM and PC remains 
      obscure and will need further investigation. According to current knowledge,
      there is a substantial link between diabetes, obesity, and dietary patterns in
      the development and progression of PC. Consequently, focusing our efforts on
      preventive measures by reducing modifiable risk factors remains the most
      effective strategy to reduce the risk of PC at this time. Antidiabetic drugs can 
      have various effects on the occurrence and prognosis of PC with metformin
      offering a clear benefit of inhibiting PC and insulin increasing the risk of PC. 
      The development of future novel therapies will require a deeper knowledge of the 
      triggering mechanisms and interplay between these two disease states.

TI  - Risk factors, mortality trends and cardiovasuclar diseases in people with Type 1 
      diabetes and controls: A Swedish observational cohort study.
PG  - 100469
LID - 10.1016/j.lanepe.2022.100469 [doi]
AB  - Background: Historically, the incidence of cardiovascular disease and mortality
      in persons with Type 1 diabetes (T1D) has been increased compared to the general 
      population. Contemporary studies on time trends of mortality and cardiovascular
      disease are sparse. Methods: In this observational study, T1D persons were
      identified in the Swedish National Diabetes Registry (n=45,575) and compared with
      matched controls from the general population (n=220,141). Incidence rates from
      2002 to 2019 were estimated with respect to mortality and cardiovascular disease 
      in persons with T1D overall and when stratified for prevalent cardiovascular and 
      renal disease relative to controls. Findings: Mean age in persons with T1D was
      32.4 years and 44.9% (20,446/45,575) were women. Age- and sex- adjusted mortality
      rates declined over time in both groups but remained significantly higher in
      those with T1D compared to controls during 2017-2019, 7.62 (95% CI 7.16; 8.08)
      vs. 2.23 (95% CI 2.13; 2.33) deaths per 1,000 person years. Myocardial
      infarction, heart failure and stroke decreased over time in both groups, with
      persistent excess risks in the range of 3.4-5.0 times from 2017 to 2019 in those 
      with T1D. T1D persons >/=45 years without previous renal or cardiovascular
      complications had standardized mortality rates similar or even lower than
      controls 5.55 (4.51; 6.60) vs.7.08 (6.75; 7.40) respectively in the last time
      period. Interpretation: Excess mortality persisted over time in persons with T1D,
      largely in patients with cardiorenal complications. Improved secondary prevention
      with a focus on individualized treatment is needed to close the gap in mortality 
      for individuals with T1D. Funding: This study was financed by grants from the
      ALF-agreement, NovoNordisk Foundation and the Swedish Heart and Lung Foundation.

TI  - Development and validation of predictive risk models for sight threatening
      diabetic retinopathy in patients with type 2 diabetes to be applied as triage
      tools in resource limited settings.
PG  - 101578
LID - 10.1016/j.eclinm.2022.101578 [doi]
AB  - Background: Delayed diagnosis and treatment of sight threatening diabetic
      retinopathy (STDR) is a common cause of visual impairment in people with Type 2
      diabetes. Therefore, systematic regular retinal screening is recommended, but
      global coverage of such services is challenging. We aimed to develop and validate
      predictive models for STDR to identify 'at-risk' population for retinal
      screening. Methods: Models were developed using datasets obtained from general
      practices in inner London, United Kingdom (UK) on adults with type 2 Diabetes
      during the period 2007-2017. Three models were developed using Cox regression and
      model performance was assessed using C statistic, calibration slope and observed 
      to expected ratio measures. Models were externally validated in cohorts from
      Wales, UK and India. Findings: A total of 40,334 people were included in the
      model development phase of which 1427 (3.54%) people developed STDR. Age, gender,
      diabetes duration, antidiabetic medication history, glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c),
      and history of retinopathy were included as predictors in the Model 1, Model 2
      excluded retinopathy status, and Model 3 further excluded HbA1c. All three models
      attained strong discrimination performance in the model development dataset with 
      C statistics ranging from 0.778 to 0.832, and in the external validation datasets
      (C statistic 0.685 - 0.823) with calibration slopes closer to 1 following
      re-calibration of the baseline survival. Interpretation: We have developed new
      risk prediction equations to identify those at risk of STDR in people with type 2
      diabetes in any resource-setting so that they can be screened and treated early. 
      Future testing, and piloting is required before implementation. Funding: This
      study was funded by the GCRF UKRI (MR/P207881/1) and supported by the NIHR
      Biomedical Research Centre at Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and
      UCL Institute of Ophthalmology.

TI  - TB disease patterns by HIV and diabetes status.
PG  - 733-740
LID - 10.5588/ijtld.21.0693 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: TB is commonly categorised as pulmonary (PTB) or extrapulmonary TB
      (EPTB). Knowledge of TB disease patterns (PTB and/or EPTB) and determining risk
      factors remains limited.METHODS: This was a prospective cohort study using
      point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) in Indian patients with presumed TB. Clinical
      and imaging data were used to develop refined case definitions for PTB,
      concurrent PTB and EPTB (PTB + EPTB) and EPTB without PTB (EPTB). These groups
      were analysed by HIV (HIV+/-) and diabetes mellitus (DM+/-) status.RESULTS: Of
      172 HIV-/DM- patients with TB, 48% had PTB, 23% PTB + EPTB and 29% had EPTB,
      totalling 52% with any EPTB (PTB + EPTB or EPTB). In HIV+/DM- patients with TB (n
      = 35), 6% had PTB, 40% had PTB + EPTB and 54% had EPTB, accounting for 94% with
      EPTB. In HIV-/DM+ patients with TB (n = 61), 61% had PTB, 28% had PTB + EPTB and 
      11% had EPTB, representing 39% with EPTB.CONCLUSION: Refined case definitions
      revealed high proportions of EPTB even without HIV or DM. HIV further altered the
      TB disease pattern towards EPTB and DM towards PTB. Therefore, the dichotomy
      between PTB or EPTB does not represent the actual spectrum of TB disease. EPTB
      should receive higher priority in research and clinical practice.

TI  - Ti2C-TiO2 MXene Nanocomposite-Based High-Efficiency Non-Enzymatic Glucose Sensing
      Platform for Diabetes Monitoring.
LID - 5589 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/s22155589 [doi]
AB  - Diabetes is a major health challenge, and it is linked to a number of serious
      health issues, including cardiovascular disease (heart attack and stroke),
      diabetic nephropathy (kidney damage or failure), and birth defects. The detection
      of glucose has a direct and significant clinical importance in the management of 
      diabetes. Herein, we demonstrate the application of in-situ synthesized Ti2C-TiO2
      MXene nanocomposite for high throughput non-enzymatic electrochemical sensing of 
      glucose. The nanocomposite was synthesized by controlled oxidation of Ti2C-MXene 
      nanosheets using H2O2 at room temperature. The oxidation results in the opening
      up of Ti2C-MXene nanosheets and the formation of TiO2 nanocrystals on their
      surfaces as revealed in microscopic and spectroscopic analysis. Nanocomposite
      exhibited considerably high electrochemical response than parent Ti2C MXene, and 
      hence utilized as a novel electrode material for enzyme-free sensitive and
      specific detection of glucose. Developed nanocomposite-based non-enzymatic
      glucose sensor (NEGS) displays a wide linearity range (0.1 microM-200 microM,
      R(2) = 0.992), high sensitivity of 75.32 muA mM(-1) cm(-2), a low limit of
      detection (0.12 muM) and a rapid response time (~3s). NEGS has further shown a
      high level of repeatability and selectivity for glucose in serum spiked samples. 
      The unveiled excellent sensing performance of NEGS is credited to synergistically
      improved electrochemical response of Ti2C MXene and TiO2 nanoparticles. All of
      these attributes highlight the potential of MXene nanocomposite as a
      next-generation NEGS for on the spot mass screening of diabetic patients.

TI  - Frailty in Community-Dwelling Adults Aged 40 Years and over with Type 2 Diabetes:
      Association with Self-Management Behaviors.
LID - 9092 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19159092 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Evidence is lacking on risk factors for frailty and prefrailty and
      their relationship with self-management behaviors in patients >/=40 years of age 
      with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: Participants were selected as a cross-sectional
      cohort at five communities in Shanghai, China during January-March 2021. The
      modified FRAIL scale and the Summary of Diabetes Self-Care Activities (SDSCA)
      measure were used. RESULTS: Of the 558 participants, 10.2% were classified as
      frailty and 34.1% as prefrailty. The prevalence of frailty was higher in males
      than in females (p = 0.009), whereas females were associated with higher odds of 
      prefrailty (aOR 1.67, 95% CI [1.08-2.60]). Multimorbidity, >/=3 chronic diseases,
      and hospitalization in the past year were considered risk factors for both
      frailty and prefrailty. Each point earned on SDSCA and physical activity were
      associated with lower odds of frailty (aOR 0.95, 95% CI [0.92-0.98]) and
      prefrailty (aOR 0.52, 95% CI [0.31-0.85]), respectively. Frail participants
      performed significantly worse self-care practice than prefrail and non-frail
      ones, especially on diet, physical activity, and medication adherence (p &lt;
      0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Frail patients >/=40 years of age with type 2 diabetes
      reported poorer self-care performance. Further interventional studies are
      warranted to clarify their causal relationship.

TI  - Health Needs Assessment: Chronic Kidney Disease Secondary to Type 2 Diabetes
      Mellitus in a Population without Social Security, Mexico 2016-2032.
LID - 9010 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19159010 [doi]
AB  - Health needs assessment is a relevant tracer of planning process of healthcare
      programs. The objective is to assess the health needs of chronic kidney disease
      (CKD) secondary to type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2 DM) in a population without
      social security in Mexico. The study design was a statistical simulation model
      based on data at the national level of Mexico. A stochastic Markov model was used
      to simulate the progression from diabetes to CKD. The time horizon was 16 years. 
      The results indicate that in 2022, kidney damage progression and affectation in
      the diabetic patient cohort will be 34.15% based on the time since T2 DM
      diagnosis. At the end of the 16-year period, assuming that the model of care
      remains unchanged, early renal involvement will affect slightly more than twice
      as many patients (118%) and cases with macroalbuminuria will triple (228%). The
      need for renal replacement therapy will more than double (169%). Meanwhile,
      deaths associated with cardiovascular risk will more than triple (284%). We
      concluded that the clinical manifestations of patients with CKD secondary to T2
      DM without social security constitute a double challenge. The first refers to the
      fact that the greatest health need is early care of CKD, and the second is the
      urgent need to address cardiovascular risk in order to reduce deaths in the
      population at risk.

TI  - Association between Health Literacy and Prevalence of Obesity, Arterial
      Hypertension, and Diabetes Mellitus.
LID - 9002 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19159002 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Health literacy (HL) is linked to many health outcomes, including
      self-management of chronic diseases. The aim of this study was to assess the
      association of health literacy with the prevalence of obesity, arterial
      hypertension (AH), and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). METHODS: This
      cross-sectional, single-center study included 500 patients (42.2% male and 57.8% 
      females; median age, 63 years (interquartile range, 42-73)) hospitalized at
      General County Hospital in Pozega, Croatia, between July and October 2020. The
      Short Assessment of Health Literacy for Croatian Adults (SAHLCA-50) questionnaire
      was used. Descriptive statistics (median with interquartile range (IQR),
      frequency, and percentages) and binary logistic regression were utilized.
      RESULTS: Patients with AH had an inadequate level of health literacy as compared 
      to those without AH (32 vs. 40 points; Mann-Whitney U test, p &lt; 0.001).
      Patients with T2DM scored 31 points versus 39 points in patients without T2DM
      (Mann-Whitney U test, p &lt; 0.001). Patients suffering from both AH and T2DM
      scored 31 points versus 33 points in those with either AH or T2DM and 41 points
      in patients without AH and T2DM (Kruskal-Wallis test, p &lt; 0.001). There were
      no statistically significant differences in SAHLCA-50 scores according to the
      patient body mass index. CONCLUSIONS: An inadequate level of health literacy is
      significantly associated with AH and T2DM but not with obesity. Male gender, low 
      level of education, rural place of residence, retirement, and older age are
      significant predictors of inadequate health literacy.

TI  - Personalised Dosing Using the CURATE.AI Algorithm: Protocol for a Feasibility
      Study in Patients with Hypertension and Type II Diabetes Mellitus.
LID - 8979 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19158979 [doi]
AB  - Chronic diseases typically require long-term management through healthy lifestyle
      practices and pharmacological intervention. Although efficacious treatments
      exist, disease control is often sub-optimal leading to chronic disease-related
      sequela. Poor disease control can partially be explained by the 'one size fits
      all' pharmacological approach. Precision medicine aims to tailor treatments to
      the individual. CURATE.AI is a dosing optimisation platform that considers
      individual factors to improve the precision of drug therapies. CURATE.AI has been
      validated in other therapeutic areas, such as cancer, but has yet to be applied
      in chronic disease care. We will evaluate the CURATE.AI system through a
      single-arm feasibility study (n = 20 hypertensives and n = 20 type II diabetics).
      Dosing decisions will be based on CURATE.AI recommendations. We will
      prospectively collect clinical and qualitative data and report on the clinical
      effect, implementation challenges, and acceptability of using CURATE.AI. In
      addition, we will explore how to enhance the algorithm further using
      retrospective patient data. For example, the inclusion of other variables, the
      simultaneous optimisation of multiple drugs, and the incorporation of other
      artificial intelligence algorithms. Overall, this project aims to understand the

TI  - Socioeconomic Inequalities in the Prevalence of Diabetes in Argentina: A Repeated
      Cross-Sectional Study in Urban Women and Men.
LID - 8888 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19158888 [doi]
AB  - This study measured the socioeconomic inequalities in the prevalence of diabetes 
      between 2005 and 2018 in an urban Argentinian population. Data were obtained from
      the repeated cross-sectional surveys "National Survey of Risk Factors" (ENFR is
      its acronym in Spanish). From 2005 to 2018, four rounds of ENFR were administered
      to men and women over 18 years of age. Concentration curves (CC) and the
      Erreygers concentration index (ECI) were used to describe the socioeconomic
      inequalities in diabetes' prevalence. A decomposition analysis was performed to
      determine the contribution of each variable to inequality in diabetes'
      prevalence. Data from 41,219 (2005), 34,583 (2009), 32,232 (2013), and 29,094
      (2018) individuals were analyzed. Women reported a greater prevalence of diabetes
      compared with men for all the years included. According to the CC and ECI, we
      found no evidence of inequality in men throughout all study years. For women,
      throughout all years, the CCs were above the line of equity, and the ECIs during 
      all the years were negative and different from zero (p &lt; 0.01). For women, we 
      found no evidence of a reduction in inequalities between 2005 and 2018 (p =
      0.475). The socioeconomic inequality for women was largely driven by public
      insurance, primary and secondary education, and employment. Diabetes' prevalence 
      was not associated with socioeconomic status in men, while the prevalence of
      diabetes in women was more concentrated among poorer women. During the 13 years, 
      there was no evidence of a reduction of inequality in women, noting that
      interventions must prioritize and should focus on the main contribution of
      inequalities, such as education and employment.

TI  - Bayesian Spatial Modeling of Diabetes and Hypertension: Results from the South
      Africa General Household Survey.
LID - 8886 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19158886 [doi]
AB  - Determining spatial links between disease risk and socio-demographic
      characteristics is vital in disease management and policymaking. However, data
      are subject to complexities caused by heterogeneity across host classes and space
      epidemic processes. This study aims to implement a spatially varying coefficient 
      (SVC) model to account for non-stationarity in the effect of covariates. Using
      the South Africa general household survey, we study the provincial variation of
      people living with diabetes and hypertension risk through the SVC model. The
      people living with diabetes and hypertension risk are modeled using a logistic
      model that includes spatially unstructured and spatially structured random
      effects. Spatial smoothness priors for the spatially structured component are
      employed in modeling, namely, a Gaussian Markov random field (GMRF), a
      second-order random walk (RW2), and a conditional autoregressive (CAR) model. The
      SVC model is used to relax the stationarity assumption in which non-linear
      effects of age are captured through the RW2 and allow the mean effect to vary
      spatially using a CAR model. Results highlight a non-linear relationship between 
      age and people living with diabetes and hypertension. The SVC models outperform
      the stationary models. The results suggest significant provincial differences,
      and the maps provided can guide policymakers in carefully exploiting the
      available resources for more cost-effective interventions.

TI  - Islet allografts expressing a PD-L1 and IDO fusion protein evade immune rejection
      and reverse preexisting diabetes in immunocompetent mice without systemic
      immunosuppression.
LID - 10.1111/ajt.17162 [doi]
AB  - Allogeneic islet transplantation is a promising experimental therapy for poorly
      controlled diabetes. Despite pharmacological immunosuppression, long-term islet
      engraftment remains elusive. Here, we designed a synthetic fusion transgene
      coupling PD-L1 and indoleamine dioxygenase [hereafter PIDO] whose constitutive
      expression prevents immune destruction of genetically engineered islet allograft 
      transplanted in immunocompetent mice. PIDO expressing murine islets maintain
      robust dynamic insulin secretion in vitro and when transplanted in allogeneic
      hyperglycemic murine recipients reverse pre-existing streptozotocin-induced and
      autoimmune diabetes in the absence of pharmacological immunosuppression for more 
      than 50 and 8 weeks, respectively, and is dependent on host CD4 competence.
      Additionally, PIDO expression in allografts preserves endocrine functional
      viability of islets and promotes a localized tolerogenic milieu characterized by 
      the suppression of host CD8 T cell and phagocyte recruitment and accumulation of 
      FOXP3(+) Tregs. Furthermore, in the canine model of xenogeneic islet
      transplantation, muscle implanted PIDO-expressing porcine islets displayed
      physiological glucose-responsive insulin secretion competency in euglycemic
      recipient for up to 20 weeks. In conclusion, the PIDO transgenic technology
      enables host CD4(+) T cell-modulated immune evasiveness and long-term functional 
      viability of islet allo- and xenografts in immune-competent recipients without
      the need for pharmacological immune suppression and would allow for improved
      outcomes for tissue transplantation.

      educational attainment: a population-based sibling-comparison study.
LID - 10.1111/apa.16500 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To examine the association of childhood-onset type 1 diabetes (T1D) and
      attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) with educational outcomes from
      compulsory school to university. METHODS: Using multiple Swedish nationwide
      registers, we followed up on 1,474,941 individuals born in Sweden from 1981-1995 
      to December 31, 2013. Associations of T1D and ADHD with achieving educational
      milestones (from compulsory school to university) and school performances were
      estimated using logistic and linear regression models and sibling comparison
      models. RESULTS: Compared to their peers, children with both T1D and ADHD were
      less likely to achieve any of the educational attainments, including completing
      compulsory school (adjusted OR [aOR] [95% CI]: 0.43[0.26,0.72]), be eligible to
      and finishing upper secondary school (0.26[0.19,0.36], 0.24[0.17,0.35],
      respectively), and starting university (0.38[0.17,0.90]). The odds of achieving
      these educational milestones were substantially lower in children with ADHD alone
      (aORs: 0.14-0.44), but were slightly worse or no differences in children with T1D
      alone (aORs: 0.86-1.08). All associations above remained similar in the sibling
      comparison models. CONCLUSION: Children and adolescents with both T1D and ADHD
      had long-term educational underachievement, with ADHD being the major
      contributor. Our findings suggest the importance of assessing ADHD in children
      with T1D and targeted support for minimizing the education gap between the
      affected children and their peers.

TI  - Nonlinear association between changes in fasting plasma glucose and the incidence
      of diabetes in a nondiabetic Chinese cohort.
PG  - 191
LID - 10.1186/s12902-022-01094-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Limited data show that changes in fasting plasma glucose (FPG
      changes) are related to the incidence of type 2 diabetes (T2D). We aimed to
      correlate FPG changes with incident diabetes and evaluate FPG changes as a marker
      to screen participants at high risk of T2D in China. METHODS: A total of 116,816 
      individuals were followed during a median follow-up of 3.10 years by secondary
      analysis in a nondiabetic Chinese cohort. The turning points were derived from a 
      receiver operating characteristic curve. Hazard ratios (HRs) were evaluated by
      Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: A total of 2669 cases of T2D were
      identified (788 women and 1881 men). The age-standardized incidence of diabetes
      was 12.87 per 1000 person-years (women: 11.04; men: 14.69). A nonlinear
      relationship between FPG changes and incident diabetes is shown by the fitting
      curves. The curves were categorized into three stages by two turning points
      (-0.04 and 1.25 mmol/L) and conformed to the hook-like pattern: an initial
      decrease (stage-1), then a transient sharp elevation (stage-2), followed by a
      slow increase (stage-3). HRs per SD of FPG changes on incident diabetes varied
      with stage: stage-1: 0.16 (0.12, 0.23), stage-2: 0.20 (0.15, 0.28) and stage-3:
      0.22 (0.16, 0.31). Compared with stage-1, the HR in stage-3 was significantly
      higher at 28.05 (23.99, 32.79), while the increase in stage-2 was slight at 2.16 
      (1.79, 2.61), and the HR in stage-3 rose to 30.09 (25.02, 36.19). CONCLUSIONS:
      FPG changes had a strong correlation with the incidence of T2D and was a steady
      indicator that was used to distinguish the participants at high risk of diabetes.

TI  - The sonographic quantitative assessment of the deltoid muscle to detect type 2
      diabetes mellitus: a potential noninvasive and sensitive screening method?
PG  - 193
LID - 10.1186/s12902-022-01107-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In our previous published study, we demonstrated that a qualitatively
      assessed elevation in deltoid muscle echogenicity on ultrasound was both
      sensitive for and a strong predictor of a type 2 diabetes (T2DM) diagnosis. This 
      study aims to evaluate if a sonographic quantitative assessment of the deltoid
      muscle can be used to detect T2DM. METHODS: Deltoid muscle ultrasound images from
      124 patients were stored: 31 obese T2DM, 31 non-obese T2DM, 31 obese non-T2DM and
      31 non-obese non-T2DM. Images were independently reviewed by 3 musculoskeletal
      radiologists, blinded to the patient's category. Each measured the grayscale
      pixel intensity of the deltoid muscle and humeral cortex to calculate a
      muscle/bone ratio for each patient. Following a 3-week delay, the 3 radiologists 
      independently repeated measurements on a randomly selected 40 subjects. Ratios,
      age, gender, race, body mass index, insulin usage and hemoglobin A1c were
      analyzed. The difference among the 4 groups was compared using analysis of
      variance or chi-square tests. Both univariate and multivariate linear mixed
      models were performed. Multivariate mixed-effects regression models were used,
      adjusting for demographic and clinical variables. Post hoc comparisons were done 
      with Bonferroni adjustments to identify any differences between groups. The
      sample size achieved 90% power. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated based
      on set threshold ratios. Both intra- and inter-radiologist variability or
      agreement were assessed. RESULTS: A statistically significant difference in
      muscle/bone ratios between the groups was identified with the average ratios as
      follows: obese T2DM, 0.54 (P < 0.001); non-obese T2DM, 0.48 (P < 0.001); obese
      non-T2DM, 0.42 (P = 0.03); and non-obese non-T2DM, 0.35. There was excellent
      inter-observer agreement (intraclass correlation coefficient 0.87) and excellent 
      intra-observer agreements (intraclass correlation coefficient 0.92, 0.95 and
      0.94). Using threshold ratios, the sensitivity for detecting T2DM was 80% (95% CI
      67% to 88%) with a specificity of 63% (95% CI 50% to 75%). CONCLUSIONS: The
      sonographic quantitative assessment of the deltoid muscle by ultrasound is
      sensitive and accurate for the detection of T2DM. Following further studies, this
      process could translate into a dedicated, simple and noninvasive screening method
      to detect T2DM with the prospects of identifying even a fraction of the
      undiagnosed persons worldwide. This could prove especially beneficial in
      screening of underserved and underrepresented communities.

TI  - Risk factors for cognitive decline in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients in
      Brazil: a prospective observational study.
PG  - 105
LID - 10.1186/s13098-022-00872-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) patients are twice as likely to
      develop dementia. The study's goal was to evaluate cognitive performance and risk
      factors for cognitive decline in this population. METHODS: Prospective
      observational study was conducted with 400 T2DM adults, of whom, during routine
      baseline and follow-up appointments, had socio-demographic, clinical, and
      laboratory data collected, and underwent physical examination, screening for
      depression symptoms (Patient Health Questionaire-9-PHQ-9), and cognitive tests:
      Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Semantic Verbal Fluency Test, Trail Making 
      Test A/B, and Word Memory Tests. Each cognitive test score was converted to a
      z-score and its average resulted in a new variable called Global Cognitive
      z-Score [GCS(z)]. Averages of the cognitive test scores and GCS(z) at both
      moments were compared by the Student's T-Test for paired samples. Multivariate
      binary logistic regression models were built to assess the association of GCS(z) 
      < zero with risk factors for cognitive decline at the baseline and follow-up.
      RESULTS: After exclusions, 251 patients were eligible, being 56.6% female, mean
      age of 61.1 (+/- 9.8) years, 12.6 (+/- 8.9) years of DM duration, and 7.6 (+/-
      4.2) years of school education. Follow-up had 134 patients reevaluated and took
      place after a mean of 18.4(+/- 5.0) months. Eleven (14%) patients with a GCS(z)
      >/= 0 at baseline turned into a GCS(z) < 0 at follow-up. There were no
      significant differences between the means of cognitive test scores and GCS(z) at 
      the two evaluation moments. At the baseline, the multivariate logistic regression
      model identified five risk factors associated with GCS(z) < zero: age >/= 65
      years, schooling </= 6 years, arterial hypertension, depression symptoms, and
      diabetic retinopathy (DR), with odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval
      (CI95%) respectively: 5.46 (2.42-12.34); 12.19 (5.62-26.46); 2.55 (0.88-7.39);
      3.53 (1.55-8.07) e 2.50 (1.18-5.34). At follow-up, the risk factors for GCS(z) < 
      zero were: schooling </= 6 years, DM duration >/= 10 years, depression symptoms, 
      arterial hypertension, and cardiovascular disease (CVD), OR and CI95%
      respectively: 10.15 (3.68-28.01); 2.68 (0.96-7.48); 4.92 (1.77-13.70); 7.21
      (1.38-35.71) e 5.76 (1.93-17.18). CONCLUSIONS: Based on our results, cognitive
      evaluation and follow-up should be incorporated on the routine of T2DM patients, 
      especially for those with advanced age, low education level, prolonged DM
      duration, arterial hypertension, depression symptoms, CVD, and DR.

TI  - Health effects of reduced occupational sedentary behaviour in type 2 diabetes
      using a mobile health intervention: a study protocol for a 12-month randomized
      controlled trial-the ROSEBUD study.
PG  - 607
LID - 10.1186/s13063-022-06528-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Short-term trials conducted in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus
      (T2DM) showed that reducing sedentary behaviour by performing regular short bouts
      of light-intensity physical activity enhances health. Moreover, support for
      reducing sedentary behaviour may be provided at a low cost via mobile health
      technology (mHealth). There are a wide range of mHealth solutions available
      including SMS text message reminders and activity trackers that monitor the
      physical activity level and notify the user of prolonged sitting periods. The aim
      of this study is to evaluate the effects of a mHealth intervention on sedentary
      behaviour and physical activity and the associated changes in health in adults
      with T2DM. METHODS: A dual-arm, 12-month, randomized controlled trial (RCT) will 
      be conducted within a nationwide Swedish collaboration for diabetes research in
      primary health care. Individuals with T2DM (n = 142) and mainly sedentary work
      will be recruited across primary health care centres in five regions in Sweden.
      Participants will be randomized (1:1) into two groups. A mHealth intervention
      group who will receive an activity tracker wristband (Garmin Vivofit4), regular
      SMS text message reminders, and counselling with a diabetes specialist nurse, or 
      a comparator group who will receive counselling with a diabetes specialist nurse 
      only. The primary outcomes are device-measured total sitting time and total
      number of steps (activPAL3). The secondary outcomes are fatigue, health-related
      quality of life and musculoskeletal problems (self-reported questionnaires),
      number of sick leave days (diaries), diabetes medications (clinical record
      review) and cardiometabolic biomarkers including waist circumference, mean blood 
      pressure, HbA1c, HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides. DISCUSSION: Successful
      interventions to increase physical activity among those with T2DM have been
      costly and long-term effectiveness remains uncertain. The use of mHealth
      technologies such as activity trackers and SMS text reminders may increase
      awareness of prolonged sedentary behaviour and encourage increase in regular
      physical activity. mHealth may, therefore, provide a valuable and novel tool to
      improve health outcomes and clinical management in those with T2DM. This 12-month
      RCT will evaluate longer-term effects of a mHealth intervention suitable for
      real-world primary health care settings. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov

TI  - Acute and chronic kidney complications in children with type 1 diabetes mellitus.
LID - 10.1007/s00467-022-05689-w [doi]
AB  - Children with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) have an increased risk of
      developing kidney involvement. Part of the risk establishes at the beginning of
      T1DM. In fact, up to 65% of children during T1DM onset may experience an acute
      kidney injury (AKI) which predisposes to the development of a later chronic
      kidney disease (CKD). The other part of the risk establishes during the following
      course of T1DM and could be related to a poor glycemic control and the subsequent
      development of diabetic kidney disease. In this review, we discuss the acute and 
      chronic effects of T1DM on the kidneys, and the implications of these events on
      the long-term prognosis of kidney function.

TI  - Development of PRAPARE Social Determinants of Health Clusters and Correlation
      with Diabetes and Hypertension Outcomes.
PG  - 668-679
LID - 10.3122/jabfm.2022.04.200462 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: PRAPARE is a leading social risk screening tool. No studies yet
      have simplified the 22 PRAPARE social determinants of health (SDoH) into clusters
      to analyze associations with chronic disease outcomes. METHODS: A federally
      qualified health center conducted cross-sectional PRAPARE screening on its
      general adult population. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were used 
      to identify SDoH clusters and construct cluster scores and SDoH total risk
      scores. Logistic regression assessed relationships between cluster scores and
      uncontrolled diabetes and/or hypertension. RESULTS: Of the 11,773 adults who
      answered the survey, 716 had diabetes only, 2,388 had hypertension only, 1,477
      had both, and 7,192 had neither. We found 3 composite SDoH clusters (social
      background, social insecurities, insurance/employment) and 3 standalone clusters 
      (housing status, social isolation, poverty). Among patients with diabetes, those 
      at risk in social background, social insecurities, and insurance/employment were 
      more likely to have uncontrolled diabetes. Among patients with hypertension,
      those at more risk in social insecurities were more likely to have uncontrolled
      hypertension. CONCLUSIONS: We simplified the 22 PRAPARE SDoH into 3 composite
      clusters and 3 individual clusters and demonstrated the reliability and validity 
      of PRAPARE. The 3 composite clusters were positively associated with uncontrolled
      diabetes and/or hypertension.

TI  - A novel model mouse for type 2 diabetes mellitus with early onset and persistent 
      hyperglycemia.
LID - 10.1538/expanim.22-0061 [doi]
AB  - Various mouse models of type 2 diabetes have been established, but few of these
      show early onset and persistent hyperglycemia. We have established a congenic
      mouse strain (NSY.B6-Tyr(+),A(y)) in which a spontaneous mutation of the agouti
      yellow (A(y)) gene, which causes obesity by hyperphagia, was introduced into the 
      NSY strain, which shows increased glucose intolerance with age. This strain has
      been maintained as a segregating inbred strain by mating obese yellow (A(y)/a)
      males with normal black (a/a) females. All yellow males showed marked obesity and
      hyperglycemia (mean blood glucose level >400 mg/dl) from 10 to 24 weeks of age.
      The yellow males also showed glucose intolerance and insulin resistance. They
      provide a potentially valuable model mouse for research into type 2 diabetes,
      hyperlipidemia, fatty liver, and renal glomerular complications. Yellow female
      mice also showed marked obesity, but the incidence of diabetes and the severity
      of various pathological conditions were milder than in yellow males. None of the 
      black mice showed hyperglycemia in either sex. NSY.B6-Tyr(+),A(y) strain has good
      fertility and does not display inter-male aggression, making them useful as a new
      model for type 2 diabetes with early onset and persistent hyperglycemia.

TI  - Exenatide challenge in oral glucose tolerance test is insufficient for
      predictions of glucose metabolism and insulin secretion after sleeve gastrectomy 
      (SG) in obese patients with type 2 diabetes: a pilot study to establish a
      preoperative model to estimate beta-cell function following augmented
      glucagon-like peptide-1 secretion after SG.
LID - 10.1507/endocrj.EJ22-0224 [doi]
AB  - The postoperative increase in glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is the main factor 
      to improve glucose metabolism following sleeve gastrectomy (SG) in obese patients
      with type 2 diabetes. We investigated whether the beta-cell responsiveness to an 
      injection of exogenous GLP-1 in the preoperative period could determine the
      postoperative glucose tolerance in 18 patients underwent SG. In the preoperative 
      period, a regular oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and an exenatide-challenge
      during OGTT (Ex-OGTT) were performed to evaluate the beta-cell function and its
      responsiveness to GLP-1. The postoperative glucose tolerance was evaluated by
      another regular OGTT performed at 3 months after SG. The significant decrease in 
      glucose levels with enhanced secretions of insulin and GLP-1 was observed in OGTT
      at 3 months after SG. The area under the curve of glucose from 0 to 120 minutes
      (AUC glucose0-120 min) and the insulinogenic index (I.I.) in OGTT at 3 months
      post-SG were significantly improved compared to those in preoperative period, but
      comparable with those in Ex-OGTT. AUC glucose0-120 min and I.I. in OGTT at 3
      months post-SG were significantly correlated with not only those in Ex-OGTT, but 
      also those in the preoperative regular OGTT. Conversely, the correlations
      calculated by the Spearman's rho were stronger in the latter than the former.
      This exenatide-challenge protocol might be useful to estimate glucose tolerance
      and insulin secretion after SG, however, it may be insufficient to improve
      predictability of a patient who is likely to achieve a significant benefit on
      glucose metabolism from receiving SG.

AB  - Tissue engineering (TE) has become a new effective solution to a variety of
      medical problems, including diabetes. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which have
      the ability to differentiate into endodermal and mesodermal cells, appear to be
      appropriate for this function. The purpose of this review was to evaluate the
      outcomes of various researches on the insulin-producing cells (IPCs) generation
      from MSCs with TE approaches to increase efficacy of T1D treatments. The search
      was performed in PubMed/Medline, Scopus, and Embase databases until 2021. Studies
      revealed that MSCs could also differentiate into IPCs under certain conditions.
      Therefore, a wide range of protocols have been used for this differentiation, but
      their effectiveness is very different. Scaffolds can provide a microenvironment
      that enhances the MSCs to IPCs differentiation, improves their metabolic
      activity, and up-regulate pancreatic-specific transcription factors. They also
      preserve IPCs architecture and enhance insulin production as well as protect
      against cell death. This systematic review offers a framework for prospective
      research based on data. In vitro and in vivo evidence suggests that
      scaffold-based TE can improves the viability and function of IPCs.

TI  - Comparison of hematological parameters between type 2 diabetes mellitus patients 
      and healthy controls at Dessie comprehensive specialized hospital, Northeast
      Ethiopia: Comparative cross-sectional study.
PG  - e0272145
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0272145 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic condition associated with raised 
      levels of blood glucose due to the body cannot produce any or enough insulin
      hormone or cannot be effectively utilized the produced insulin by the body.
      Patients with poorly controlled diabetes show a significant alteration in various
      parameters including metabolic, cellular, immunological, and hematological
      disturbances that leads to vascular complications. Thus, the main aim of this
      study is to compare hematological parameters between type 2 diabetes mellitus
      (T2DM) patients and healthy controls. METHODS: A comparative cross-sectional
      study was conducted in Dessie comprehensive specialized hospital from January to 
      June 2021. A total of 240 study participants consisting of 120 T2DM patients and 
      120 healthy controls were recruited using a systematic random sampling technique.
      Hematological parameters were determined using the DIRUI BF6500 automated
      hematology analyzer. Independent T-test was used to compare the mean of
      hematological parameters between T2DM patients and healthy controls. Pearson
      correlation test was used to determine the correlation between FBG, BMI, SBP,
      DBP, and hematological parameters in T2DM patients. Multivariate logistic
      regression was used to assess the association between socio-demographic and
      clinical variables with anemia. The result was expressed in mean and standard
      deviation and presented in texts and tables. P-value < 0.05 was considered to be 
      statistically significant. RESULTS: The mean and standard deviation of monocyte
      count, basophil count, monocyte %, basophil %, RBC count, hematocrit, MCV, MCH,
      RDW-SD, MPV, PDW, PLC-R, and plateletcrit showed a significant difference between
      T2DM patients and healthy control group. Pearson correlation coefficient showed
      that the total WBC count, neutrophil count, monocyte count, basophil count,
      RDW-CV, PDW, MPV, PLC-R, and plateletcrit were statistically positively
      correlated with FBG whereas RBC count, Hgb, hematocrit, MCV, MCH, and RDW-SD were
      statistically negatively correlated with FBG in T2DM patients. Moreover, total
      WBC count, neutrophil count, monocyte count, basophil count, Hgb, and
      plateletcrit were statistically positively correlated with BMI while RBC count,
      Hgb, hematocrit, MCV, MCH, and RDW-SD were statistically negatively correlated
      with BMI in T2DM patients. On the other hand, DBP was significantly positively
      correlated with platelet count and RDW-CV whereas SBP also significantly
      positively correlated with total WBC count, neutrophil count, basophil count, and
      PDW. Besides, DBP and SBP showed statistically significant negative correlations 
      with RBC count, Hgb level, and Hct value in T2DM patients. The overall prevalence
      of anemia was 25.8% in T2DM patients with a higher prevalence of anemia (16.7%)
      in female patients. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that being
      non-employee worker (AOR: 3.6, 95% CI, 1.4-46.0, P = 0.002), presence of
      neuropathy (AOR: 13.40, 95% CI, 6.83-26.28, P = 0.00), and duration of the
      disease >/= 5 years (AOR = 3.2, 95% CI, 1.2-15.3, P = 0.03) have had
      statistically significant association with anemia inT2DM patients. CONCLUSIONS:
      Patients with T2DM may have significant alterations in various hematological
      parameters. Hematological parameters should be regularly tested for early
      diagnosis and proper management of diabetes-related complications.

AB  - Glucagon-like peptide receptor-1 agonists have a key place in the hypoglycemic
      treatment of type 2 diabetes. The possibilities of their administration are now
      well outlined as well as their use in both the step-up and step-down antidiabetic
      therapy, the advantages and potential disadvantages of the already available oral
      version over the parenteral formulation, and the possible differentiation options
      for their basal insulin-combined variants. These issues are reviewed in the
      article, but recent research on the drug group, monotherapeutic and combination
      products being under development are also briefly discussed. Attention is drawn
      on the importance of the early introduction of any of their long-acting
      derivates, the cardiorenal protective effect, powerful glycemic effect, weight
      loss promoting property and low hypoglycemic risk. It is important to keep
      doctors continuously informed about the latest results of this area as well as
      the correct patient education. Orv Hetil. 2022; 163(29): 1144-1151.

TI  - Effect of Topical Application and/or Systemic Use of Red Ginseng Extract on Wound
      Healing in Rats With Experimentally Induced Diabetes.
PG  - 28-37
AB  - BACKGROUND: Red ginseng (Rg) is an herbal product that has been used in
      traditional medicine in Asian and European countries for many years. PURPOSE: To 
      study the effects of Rg extract on wound healing when used systemically, locally,
      or in combination in rats with experimentally induced diabetes. METHODS: A total 
      of 60 rats were randomly divided into 4 groups: saline (control), local Rg (LRg),
      systemic Rg (SRg), and local + systemic = combined Rg (CRg). A full-thickness
      wound (2 cm x 1 cm) was created on the back of the rats, and treatment protocols 
      were carried out for 14 days. Wound areas of all rats were measured on days 0 and
      14. Tissue samples were taken from the wound areas for histopathologic evaluation
      of inflammation, epithelialization, and fibrosis. Vascular endothelial growth
      factor (VEGF), CD4+, and CD8+ expressions were examined by immunohistochemistry. 
      RESULTS: Wound contraction measurements were 63.8%, 80.5%, 88.5%, and 86.6% in
      the control, LRg, SRg and CRg groups, respectively. Although significant
      differences were observed for all treated groups (LRg, SRg, and CRg) compared
      with the control group in terms of wound contraction, there was no difference
      among the treatment groups. VEGF-positive vessel/mm2 was observed 4.00 +/- 0.75, 
      5.93 +/- 0.70, 5.93 +/- 1.93, and 7.93 +/- 0.70 in the control, LRg, SRg and CRg 
      groups, respectively. There was no difference between LRg and SRg in terms of
      VEGF expression, but there was significant difference for all other groups
      compared with each other. CONCLUSION: All usage methods of Rg extract increased
      wound contraction, and differences were observed compared with the control group.
      However, the authors believe that the combined usage was more effective due to
      higher VEGF expression levels and lower CD4+:CD8+ ratio.

TI  - Comparison of Tofogliflozin and Glimepiride Effects on Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver
      Disease in Participants With Type 2 Diabetes: A Randomized, 48-Week, Open-Label, 
      Active-Controlled Trial.
LID - dc212049 [pii]
LID - 10.2337/dc21-2049 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a liver phenotype of type 
      2 diabetes and obesity. Currently, the efficacy of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2
      (SGLT2) inhibitors and sulfonylureas in liver pathology and hepatic gene
      expression profiles for type 2 diabetes with NAFLD are unknown. RESEARCH DESIGN
      AND METHODS: We conducted a 48 week, randomized, open-label, parallel-group trial
      involving participants with biopsy-confirmed NAFLD. A total of 40 participants
      were randomly assigned to receive once daily 20 mg tofogliflozin or 0.5 mg
      glimepiride. The primary outcome was the percentage of participants with at least
      an improvement in all individual scores for histological categories of steatosis,
      hepatocellular ballooning, lobular inflammation, and fibrosis by at least 1
      point. The secondary end points were the changes in liver enzymes, metabolic
      markers, and hepatic gene expression profiles. RESULTS: Fibrosis scores improved 
      in the tofogliflozin group (60%, P = 0.001), whereas the change from baseline did
      not differ significantly between the groups (P = 0.172). The histological
      variables of steatosis (65%, P = 0.001), hepatocellular ballooning (55%, P =
      0.002), and lobular inflammation (50%, P = 0.003) were improved in the
      tofogliflozin group, whereas only hepatocellular ballooning was improved in the
      glimepiride group (25%, P = 0.025). Hepatic gene expression profiling revealed
      histology-associated signatures in energy metabolism, inflammation, and fibrosis 
      that were reversed with tofogliflozin. CONCLUSIONS: Tofogliflozin and, to a
      lesser degree, glimepiride led to liver histological and metabolic improvement in
      participants with type 2 diabetes and NAFLD, with no significant difference
      between the agents. The hepatic expression of the genes involved in energy
      metabolism, inflammation, and fibrosis was well correlated with liver
      histological changes and rescued by tofogliflozin. We need further confirmation
      through long-term larger-scale clinical trials of SGLT2 inhibitors.

TI  - Use of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors and the risk for sudden cardiac 
      arrest and for all-cause death in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
LID - pvac043 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/ehjcvp/pvac043 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2is) are antidiabetic
      agents that can have direct cardiac effects by impacting on cardiac ion transport
      mechanisms that control cardiac electrophysiology. We studied the association
      between SGLT-2i use and all-cause mortality and the risk of sudden cardiac arrest
      (SCA) in patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: Using data from the UK Clinical 
      Practice Research Datalink, a cohort study among patients initiating a new
      antidiabetic drug class on or after January 2013 through September 2020 was
      conducted. Cox regression with time-dependent covariates was performed to
      estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) of SCA and all-cause mortality comparing
      SGLT-2is with other second- to third-line antidiabetic drugs. Stratified analyses
      were performed according to sex, diabetes duration (<5 or >/= 5 years), and the
      presence of cardiovascular disease. RESULTS: A total of 152 591 patients were
      included. Use of SGLT-2i was associated with reduced HR of SCA when compared to
      other second- to third-line antidiabetic drugs after adjustment for common SCA
      risk factors, although this association marginally failed to reach statistical
      significance (HR:0.62 [95%-CI:0.38-1.01]). The HR of all-cause mortality
      associated with SGLT-2i use when comparing to other second-to third-line
      antidiabetics was 0.43 (95%-CI:0.39-0.48) and did not vary by sex, diabetes
      duration or the presence of cardiovascular disease. SGLT-2i use remained
      associated with lower all-cause mortality in patients without concomitant insulin
      use (HR:0.56 [95%-CI:0.50-0.63]). CONCLUSION: SGLT-2i use was associated with
      reduced all-cause mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes. The association
      between use of SGLT-2i and reduced risk of SCA was not statistically significant.

TI  - The coexistence of autoimmune diabetes and maturity-onset diabetes of the young
      (MODY): a case series.
LID - 10.1530/EDM-21-0212 [doi]
LID - 21-0212 [pii]
AB  - Summary: The coexistence of autoimmune diabetes and maturity-onset diabetes
      (MODY) is rare. The absence of pancreatic autoantibodies is a key factor
      prompting MODY genetic testing. In this study, we report three cases of
      young-onset diabetes with progressive beta-cell dysfunction, strongly positive
      glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) antibodies, and genetic confirmation of
      pathogenic gene variants of HNF-1A, HNF-4A, and ABCC8-MODY. The first case is a
      woman diagnosed with HNF-1A-MODY diabetes more than 30 years after her diagnosis 
      of adult-onset diabetes at 25 years. She required insulin after her fourth
      pregnancy. She became ketotic on oral hypoglycaemic agents (OHAs) and
      subsequently, her GAD antibodies tested positive. The second case is a woman
      diagnosed with diabetes at 17 years who was subsequently diagnosed with
      HNF-4A-MODY after many hypoglycaemic episodes on low-dose insulin. GAD antibodies
      were strongly positive. The last case is a man diagnosed with diabetes at 26
      years who was well controlled on OHAs and required insulin years later due to
      sudden deterioration in glycaemic control. His ABCC8-MODY was diagnosed upon
      realisation of strong family history and his GAD antibodies tested positive. All 
      subjects are now treated with insulin. Less than 1% of subjects with MODY have
      positive autoantibodies. These cases highlight individuals who may have two
      different types of diabetes simultaneously or consecutively. Deterioration of
      glycaemic control in subjects with MODY diabetes should highlight the need to
      look for the emergence of autoantibodies. At each clinic visit, one should update
      the family history as MODY was diagnosed in each case after the development of
      diabetes in their offspring. Learning points: These cases highlight the rare
      coexistence of autoimmune diabetes and MODY. Deterioration of glycaemic control
      in subjects with MODY diabetes should highlight the emergence of autoantibodies. 
      One should revise and update the family history as the diagnosis of MODY was made
      after the development of diabetes in offspring. Understanding the spectrum of
      diabetes allows for precision medicine.

TI  - U-Shaped association between dietary thiamine intake and new-onset diabetes: A
      nationwide cohort study.
LID - hcac159 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/qjmed/hcac159 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The association between dietary thiamine intake and the risk of
      diabetes remains unknown. AIM: We aimed to evaluate the relation of dietary
      thiamine intake with new-onset diabetes and examine possible effect modifiers.
      DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. METHODS: A total of 16,272 participants who
      were free of diabetes at baseline were enrolled from China Health and Nutrition
      Survey (CHNS). Dietary nutrients intake information was collected by 3-day
      dietary recalls in addition to using a 3-day food-weighed method to assess
      cooking oil and condiment consumption. New-onset diabetes was defined as a
      fasting blood glucose >/= 7.0 mmol/L or a glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) >/= 6.5%
      (48 mmol/mol) or diagnosed by a physician during the follow-up. RESULTS: During a
      median follow-up duration of 9.0 years, new-onset diabetes occurred in 1101
      participants. Overall, the association between dietary thiamine intake and
      new-onset diabetes followed a U-shape (P for nonlinearity <0.001). Consistently, 
      when thiamine intake was assessed as quartiles, compared with those in the 2-3
      quartiles (0.75-<1.10 mg/day), the significantly higher risks of new-onset
      diabetes were found in participants in the first quartile (adjusted HR, 1.33;
      95%CI: 1.10, 1.61) and the fourth quartile (adjusted HR, 1.39; 95%CI: 1.17,
      1.67). Similar results were found when further adjusting for the intake of other 
      major nutrients or food groups; or using the propensity score weighting to
      control the imbalance of covariates. CONCLUSION: Our results suggested that there
      was a U-shape association between dietary thiamine intake and new-onset diabetes 
      in general Chinese adults, with a minimal risk at 0.75-1.10 mg/day.

TI  - The positive correlation between brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity and aortic
      diameter in Chinese patients with diabetes.
LID - 10.1111/jch.14548 [doi]
AB  - Aortic dilation is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases. 
      Increased brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) is a hallmark of vascular
      aging and arterial stiffness, as well as an important risk factor for vascular
      disease. This study aimed to retrospectively analyze the correlation between
      baPWV and aortic diameter (AoD) of inpatients with diabetes. A total of 1294
      diabetic patients with the detailed medical records were investigated. Arterial
      stiffness was assessed using baPWV and AoD using echocardiography. The results
      showed that baPWV and AoD increase with age (p <0.05). Based on multiple linear
      regression analysis, age, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, left atrial
      diameter, right ventricle diameter, pulmonary artery diameter, peak velocity of
      early transmitral blood flow/peak velocity of late transmitral blood flow, and
      baPWV independently correlated with AoD in patients with diabetes. Additionally, 
      an increased risk of aortic dilation occurred in the highest baPWV quartile
      compared with the lowest quartile (p <0.001). In conclusion, baPWV is
      independently and positively associated with AoD. Hence, prospective cohorts or
      randomized clinical trials will be the next step to further determine whether
      interventions designed to improve arterial stiffness in patients with diabetes
      will reduce the risk of aortic dilation.

      diabetes mellitus.
PG  - e12996

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the effects of aerobic exercise combined with 
      resistance training on serum inflammatory factors and heart rate variability
      (HRV) in women with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). METHODS: A total of 30
      patients with diabetic cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (DCAN) were randomly
      divided into a control group (n = 15) and an exercise group (n = 15). The control
      group was treated with routine hypoglycemic drugs, while the exercise group was
      treated with routine hypoglycemic drugs + resistance training (AE + RT). The
      levels of fasting plasma glucose (FBG), two-hour plasma glucose (2hPG), serum
      inflammatory factors C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor
      necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) were measured before and after the
      intervention. The HRV was evaluated by 24-h ambulatory electrocardiogram.
      RESULTS: After the intervention, the levels of FBG, 2hPG, serum inflammatory
      factors, IL-6 and TNF-alpha in the exercise group were significantly lower than
      those in the control group (p < .05) with no significant differences in serum CRP
      (p > .05). After the intervention, the HRV time domain and frequency domain
      indexes in the two groups were significantly improved compared with those before 
      the exercise experiment (p < .01) and with no significant difference in (lnlf) (p
      > .05). The time-domain indexes, i.e., SDNN and RMSSD, as well as the frequency
      domain index, i.e., (lnhf), were significantly higher in the exercise group than 
      in the control group, whereas lnlf/lnhf were significantly lower than those in
      the control group (p < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with routine hypoglycemic drug
      therapy, combining aerobic exercise and resistance training helped to reduce the 
      level of blood glucose and serum inflammatory factors in T2DM patients with DCAN,
      and improved autonomic nerve function.

TI  - The predictive value of the first trimester combined test for gestational
      diabetes mellitus.
LID - 10.5603/GP.a2022.0036 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the predictive importance of first trimester combined 
      test markers pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A), human chorionic
      gonadotropin beta (beta-hCG) and nuchal translucency (NT) for gestational
      diabetes mellitus (GDM). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Pregnant women which both first
      trimester combined test and GDM screening were performed during antenatal
      follow-up were included in this retrospective case-control study. The cases were 
      divided into two groups as GDM screening positive and negative. Demographic,
      clinical and laboratory data of both groups were compared. Predictive tests were 
      applied to the first trimester combined test data for the detection of GDM.
      RESULTS: A total of 378 patients, 171 (45.2%) in the control group and 207
      (54.8%) in the GDM group. The age (control:30.9 +/- 5.2; GDM:30.5 +/- 5.1; p =
      0.844) and NT (control:1.254 +/- 0.289; GDM:1.319 +/- 0.299; p = 0.074) data of
      the groups were statistically similar. MoM PAPP-A (GDM:0.967 +/- 0.685;
      control:1.191 +/- 0.624; p < 0.001) and MoM f-betahCG (GDM:0.9 +/- 0.602;
      control:1.103 +/- 0.746; p = 0.001) levels of the GDM group were lower than the
      control group. In the binary logistic regression model, MoM PAPP-A and MoM
      f-betahCG variables were found to be effective on GDM. In the ROC analysis of
      these variables, the MoM PAPP-A (0.654) had the highest area under the curve.
      According to the optimum cut-off point (</= 0.885) of the MoM PAPP-A, we found a 
      sensitivity of 66.7% and a specificity of 65.50% for predicting GDM. CONCLUSIONS:
      Our study showed that serum PAPP-A and f-betahCG MoM values, which are among the 
      first trimester combined test parameters, can be used in the early pregnancy
      period for the prediction of GDM.

TI  - Assessment of fetal thymus size and BMI in pregnant women with diabetes.
LID - 10.5603/GP.a2022.0020 [doi]
AB  - MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study group consisted of 63 pregnant women admitted to
      the Department of Perinatology, Obstetrics and Gynaecology. Inclusion criteria
      included patients with PGDM - 11 pregnancies, GDM1- 23 pregnancies, and GDM2 - 29
      pregnancies. Exclusion criteria included pregnant women with gestational diabetes
      and history of other comorbidities as well as multiple pregnancies, fetal
      developmental abnormalities and genetic disorders. Each patient received a
      detailed fetal ultrasound performed by the team of ultrasound experts
      specialising in obstetric ultrasonography. Fetal thymus measurements were
      obtained between 14+5 and 40+0 weeks of gestational age. After the three-vessel
      view was clearly displayed we assessed longitudinal dimensions of the thymus. The
      obtained measurements were juxtaposed with nomograms for thymus size in healthy
      foetuses whose mothers had no history of diabetes. Prior to ultrasound
      examination the participants were asked to complete a questionnaire regarding
      their body weight status before 10 weeks of gestational age. RESULTS: The
      Mann-Whitney U test was used for comparison of two groups, i.e. diabetic
      pregnancies and non-diabetic pregnancies, whereas Kruskal-Wallis H test was used 
      to compare multiple groups. A linear regression model was used to determine the
      correlation between the type of diabetes and fetal thymus size as well as between
      maternal BMI and fetal thymus size. The significance level alpha was set at 0.05.
      Thymus size is statistically smaller in foetuses of diabetic mothers when
      compared to healthy controls. Overweighted and obese pregnancy is not a factor
      affecting fetal thymus size.

TI  - Influence of gestational diabetes in twin pregnancy on the condition of newborns 
      and early neonatal complications.
LID - 10.5603/GP.a2022.0037 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Diabetes mellitus is the most common metabolic complication in
      pregnancy and increasing worldwide. In Europe, it occurs in 3-5% of pregnant
      women. The rate of twin pregnancy has been increased similarly to gestational
      diabetes mellitus (GDM). Twin pregnancy is associated with a higher complication 
      rate compared to singleton pregnancy. The growing prevalence of GDM and twin
      pregnancy has given rise to their increasing concurrent presentation. MATERIAL
      AND METHODS: The retrospective analysis included 212 twin-pregnant patients. The 
      analysis excluded cases of miscarriage and early fetal death in the first
      trimester of pregnancy. The influence of GDM on the condition of newborns and
      mothers after delivery was analyzed. For statistical analysis R 3.6.2 software
      was used. RESULTS: No statistically significant relationship between GDM and
      Non-GDM group and periparturient complications was found. Birth weight was
      significantly higher in the GDM G2 group. Apgar Score was the lowest in the GDM
      G1 group. In the group of larger newborns of the GDMG1 group respiratory distress
      syndrome (RDS) , a higher incidence of second-degree intracranial bleeding and
      grade II of preterm retinopathy were observed. There was no statistically
      significant relationship between GDM G1, GDM G2 and other neonatal complications.
      CONCLUSIONS: In summary, our results indicate that GDM in twin pregnancy does not
      increase the risk of cesarean section but increases some neonatal complications. 
      In conclusion women with twin pregnancies complicated by GDM require specialist
      care during pregnancy and childbirth should take place in a third-level reference
      center.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to explore the correlations of Lnc-UCA1/miR-138 axis
      with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) risk and neonatal prognosis. MATERIAL
      AND METHODS: First, the blood samples from sixty GDM patients and 60 healthy
      pregnant women were collected to detect the change of Lnc-UCA1/miR-138 axis by
      using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). The clinical characteristics
      of GDM patients, healthy controls, and neonates were recorded. Then, the
      correlation analysis of Lnc-UCA1, miR-138, and Lnc-UCA1/miR-138 axis levels with 
      clinicopathological characteristics was performed to explore the clinical value
      of Lnc-UCA1/miR-138 axis in GDM. Finally, the specificity and sensitivity of
      Lnc-UCA1, miR-138, and Lnc-UCA1/miR-138 axis for GDM diagnosis was evaluated
      using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. RESULTS: Our present study 
      found that, when compared with healthy pregnancies, the expression levels of
      Lnc-UCA1 and miR-138 were increased and decreased, respectively, and
      Lnc-UCA1/miR-138 axis profile was elevated. Second, Lnc-UCA1 and Lnc-UCA1/miR-138
      axis were positively correlated with fasting glucose, one-hour glucose, and
      two-hour glucose, while miR-138 showed the opposite trend. Furthermore, the area 
      under the ROC curve (AUC) were 0.8196, 0.8021, and 0.8901 for diagnostic
      efficiencies of Lnc-UCA1, miR-138, and Lnc-UCA1/miR-138, respectively. In
      addition, higher profiles of Lnc-UCA1 were correlated with birth asphyxia of
      neonate. CONCLUSIONS: Circulating Lnc-UCA1/miR-138 axis might be involved in the 
      pathogenesis of GDM and could function as a novel and effective biomarker for GDM
      risk and neonatal prognosis.

AB  - The objective is to evaluate the influence of sleep and chrononutrition on
      hypertension and diabetes in the adult population (18 years or older) in a
      municipality in Southern Brazil. This is a population-based cross-sectional
      study, developed in Criciuma, State of Santa Catarina, in 2019. The exposure
      variables were sleep duration and quality, and two of the main aspects of
      chrononutrition, the number of daily meals and the presence of breakfast. The
      outcomes studied were diabetes mellitus and systemic arterial hypertension. Crude
      and adjusted Poisson regression with robust variance was used to evaluate the
      associations between exposures and outcomes. For all analyses, the effect of the 
      sample design was considered, and the significance level adopted was 5%. In
      total, 820 patients were evaluated. The prevalence of diabetes and hypertension
      was of 19.9% and 44.1%, respectively. Individuals with worse sleep quality had a 
      higher prevalence of 33% for diabetes and 17% for hypertension, compared to those
      with good quality of sleep. Those who had four or more meals per day had a 16%
      lower prevalence of hypertension, when compared to those who had less than four
      meals. We concluded that the quality of sleep and the number of daily meals, a
      feeding behavior related to chrononutrition, were related to hypertension and
      diabetes. These results highlight the importance of public health actions that
      address new strategies for coping with these diseases focused on sleep quality
      and chrononutrition.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Diabetic kidney disease is the most common cause of chronic
      kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage kidney disease in the world. Risk factor
      modification, glucose control, and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockade 
      have remained the standard of care for 2 decades. New therapeutic agents have
      emerged in recent years, demonstrating kidney and cardiovascular benefits, and
      herein we review recent clinical trials on this topic. RECENT FINDINGS: After the
      publication of several cardiovascular outcome trials for sodium-glucose
      cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT-2i), new trials have focused ON primary
      kidney-specific outcomes demonstrating safety and benefits among patients with
      proteinuric CKD; patients with or without diabetes, and heart failure with
      preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) respectively. Similarly, nonsteroidal
      mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (ns-MRAs) and glucagon-like-peptide 1
      receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) have improved cardiovascular and kidney outcomes.
      Recently, clinical practice guidelines have also been updated to reflect this new
      evidence. SUMMARY: In summary, SGLT-2i, GLP-1 RAs, and ns-MRAs have demonstrated 
      cardiovascular and kidney benefits, including all-cause and cardiovascular
      mortality, progression to end-stage kidney disease, and hospitalizations for
      heart failure exacerbation among diverse patient population.

TI  - Neonatal outcomes following antenatal corticosteroid administration prior to
      elective caesarean delivery in women with pre-gestational diabetes: A
      retrospective cohort study.
LID - 10.1111/ajo.13586 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The benefit of antenatal corticosteroid (ACS) administration for the 
      prevention of neonatal morbidity and mortality has been well described for
      preterm infants. Some studies have demonstrated a benefit for infants born by
      elective caesarean section (CS) at late preterm or term gestations. However, the 
      neonatal benefits of ACS are not well described when given to pregnant women with
      diabetes. AIMS: The aim of this study was to evaluate the neonatal outcomes
      following ACS administration in women with pre-gestational diabetes mellitus
      (PGDM) when administered prior to elective CS after 36 weeks gestation. METHODS: 
      This retrospective observational study included all women with PGDM who gave
      birth by elective CS between 36(+0) and 38(+6) weeks gestation. Neonatal outcomes
      for exposed participants were compared to outcomes for non-exposed participants. 
      RESULTS: Of the 306 women identified, 65 (21.2%) were exposed to ACS within seven
      days prior to birth and 241 (78.8%) were not. Although not statistically
      significant, ACS-exposed infants born prior to 38(+0) weeks were less likely to
      require respiratory support or neonatal nursery admission compared to those who
      were not exposed; however, exposed infants born after 37(+0) weeks were more
      likely to require parenteral treatment for neonatal hypoglycaemia. CONCLUSION:
      This study did not demonstrate any statistically significant beneficial or
      harmful effects of ACS in neonates of women with PGDM who are born by elective
      CS. While it is plausible that ACS could reduce neonatal respiratory morbidity in
      this population, further prospective studies evaluating the benefits and harms
      are required before recommending this practice.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) management has been challenging for patients 
      with comorbidities. Patients with diabetes and COVID-19, in particular, have
      shown severe symptoms and rapid progression of the disease. They also have a high
      mortality rate compared to the non-diabetic population. The high mortality rate
      is caused in people with diabetes who are in a pro-inflammatory condition; this
      could worsen COVID-19. In addition, people with diabetes have circulatory issues 
      and COVID-19 infection can lead to further clotting problems. It is critical to
      understand the mechanisms underlying the adverse clinical outcomes in patients
      with diabetes and COVID-19. This review discusses various disease conditions
      contributing to poor prognosis in diabetic COVID-19 patients such as
      hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, impaired pancreatic function, and production
      of advanced glycation end products.

TI  - Weight loss and beta-cell responses following gastric banding or pharmacotherapy 
      in adults with impaired glucose tolerance or type 2 diabetes: a randomized trial.
PG  - 1579-1588
LID - 10.1002/oby.23475 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The extent to which weight loss contributes to increases in insulin
      sensitivity (IS) and beta-cell function after surgical or medical intervention
      has not been directly compared in individuals with impaired glucose tolerance or 
      newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes. METHODS: The Restoring Insulin Secretion (RISE) 
      Study included adults in the Beta-Cell Restoration Through Fat Mitigation Study
      (n = 88 randomized to laparoscopic gastric banding or metformin [MET]) and the
      Adult Medication Study (n = 267 randomized to placebo, MET, insulin glargine/MET,
      or liraglutide + MET [L + M]). IS and beta-cell responses were measured at
      baseline and after 12 months by modeling of oral glucose tolerance tests and
      during arginine-stimulated hyperglycemic clamps. Linear regression models
      assessed differences between and within treatments over time. RESULTS: BMI
      decreased in all treatment groups, except placebo, at 12 months. IS increased in 
      all arms except placebo and was inversely correlated with changes in BMI. L + M
      was the only treatment arm that enhanced multiple measures of beta-cell function 
      independent of weight loss. Insulin secretion decreased in the laparoscopic
      gastric banding arm proportional to increases in IS, with no net benefit on
      beta-cell function. CONCLUSIONS: Reducing demand on the beta-cell by improving IS
      through weight loss does not reverse beta-cell dysfunction. L + M was the only
      treatment that enhanced beta-cell function.

TI  - Healthful Plant-Based Diet and Incidence of Type 2 Diabetes in Asian Population.
LID - 3078 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu14153078 [doi]
AB  - Plant-based diets have been suggested to be beneficial for type 2 diabetes (T2D).
      However, studies investigating the association between the healthiness of a
      plant-based diet and T2D risk are limited. This study explored the prospective
      association between scores from three different plant-based diet indices and risk
      of T2D and investigated whether associations differ by demographic and lifestyle 
      factors in the Korean population. Data were derived from the Korean Genome and
      Epidemiology Study (KoGES), a prospective cohort study initiated between 2001 and
      2002. Dietary intakes were assessed using a validated food frequency
      questionnaire. Scores for three plant-based diet indices (overall plant-based
      diet index (PDI), healthful plant-based diet index (hPDI), and unhealthful
      plant-based diet index (uPDI)) were measured. A total of 7363 Korean adults aged 
      40-69 years without T2D and related chronic diseases at baseline were included.
      Incident T2D was defined as elevated plasma glucose (>/=126 mg/dL), self-report
      of a doctor's diagnosis of T2D, or use of oral hypoglycemic drug. Multivariable
      Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95%
      CIs for T2D risk. During a follow-up period of 14 years, 977 participants
      developed T2D. A 10-point higher score in hPDI was associated with a 14% lower
      risk of T2D (HR: 0.86, 95% CI, 0.77-0.95), adjusting for potential confounders.
      In subgroup analysis, inverse associations between hPDI and T2D risk were
      stronger in participants with a family history of T2D (HR: 0.58, 95% CI, 0.44
      0.76) or history of hypertension (HR: 0.73, 95% CI, 0.60 0.89) than those without
      a family history of T2D (p interaction = 0.01) or history of hypertension (p
      interaction = 0.04). Considering the quality of the plant foods may be important 
      for the prevention of T2D in the Korean population, which habitually consumes
      diets rich in plant foods.

TI  - Dietary Carbohydrate as Glycemic Load, Not Fat, Coupled with Genetic
      Permissiveness Favoring Rapid Growth and Extra Calories, Dictate Metabolic
      Syndrome and Diabetes Induction in Nile Rats (Arvicanthis niloticus).
LID - 3064 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu14153064 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Whether dietary carbohydrate (CHO) or fat is more involved in type 2
      diabetes (T2DM) induction uncomplicated by dietary fiber was addressed in a
      spontaneous diabetic model, the diurnal Nile rat that mimics the human condition.
      METHODS: A total of 138 male Nile rats were fed plant-based and animal-based
      saturated fat where 10% energy as CHO and fat were exchanged across 5 diets
      keeping protein constant, from 70:10:20 to 20:60:20 as CHO:fat:protein %energy.
      Diabetes induction was analyzed by: 1. diet composition, i.e., CHO:fat ratio, to 
      study the impact of diet; 2. quintiles of average caloric intake per day to study
      the impact of calories; 3. quintiles of diabetes severity to study the epigenetic
      impact on diabetes resistance. RESULTS: High glycemic load (GLoad) was most
      problematic if coupled with high caloric consumption. Diabetes severity
      highlighted rapid growth and caloric intake as likely epigenetic factors
      distorting glucose metabolism. The largest weanling rats ate more, grew faster,
      and developed more diabetes when the dietary GLoad exceeded their gene-based
      metabolic capacity for glucose disposal. Diabetes risk increased for susceptible 
      rats when energy intake exceeded 26 kcal/day and the GLoad was &gt;175/2000 kcal 
      of diet and when the diet provided &gt;57% energy as CHO. Most resistant rats ate
      &lt;25 kcal/day independent of the CHO:fat diet ratio or the GLoad adjusted to
      body size. CONCLUSION: Beyond the CHO:fat ratio and GLoad, neither the type of
      fat nor the dietary polyunsaturated/saturated fatty acid (P/S) ratio had a
      significant impact, suggesting genetic permissiveness affecting caloric and
      glucose intake and glucose disposition were key to modulating Nile rat diabetes. 
      Fat became protective by limiting GLoad when it contributed &gt;40% energy and
      displaced CHO to &lt;50% energy, thereby decreasing the number of diabetic rats
      and diabetes severity.

LID - 10.3390/nu14153044 [doi]
AB  - 3,5-Diiodothyronine (3,5-T2) has been shown to exert pleiotropic beneficial
      effects. In this study we investigated whether 3,5-T2 prevent several energy
      metabolism disorders related to type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in gerbils
      diabetes-prone P. obesus. 157 male gerbils were randomly to Natural Diet
      (ND-controlled) or a HED (High-Energy Diet) divided in: HED- controlled,
      HED-3,5-T2 and HED- Placebo groups. 3,5-T2 has been tested at 25 microg dose and 
      was administered under subcutaneous pellet implant during 10 weeks. Isolated
      hepatocytes were shortly incubated with 3,5-T2 at 10(-6) M and 10(-9) M dose in
      the presence energetic substrates. 3,5-T2 treatment reduce visceral adipose
      tissue, prevent the insulin resistance, attenuated hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia,
      and reversed liver steatosis in diabetes P. obesus. 3,5-T2 decreased
      gluconeogenesis, increased ketogenesis and enhanced respiration capacity. 3,5-T2 
      potentiates redox and phosphate potential both in cytosol and mitochondrial
      compartment. The use of 3,5-T2 as a natural therapeutic means to regulate
      cellular energy metabolism. We suggest that 3,5-T2 may help improve the
      deleterious course of obesity and T2DM, but cannot replace medical treatment.

TI  - Association between Obesity and Intake of Different Food Groups among Japanese
      with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus-Japan Diabetes Clinical Data Management Study
      (JDDM68).

LID - 10.3390/nu14153034 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We investigated the association between various food groups and
      obesity in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: 2070 patients with
      type 2 diabetes who attended 26 diabetes clinics throughout Japan were analyzed
      and were divided into obese and non-obese groups. Intakes of food groups
      determined by a food frequency questionnaire were compared. Odds ratios for
      obesity for quartiles of individual food groups were calculated using a logistic 
      regression model. RESULTS: Non-obese patients consumed a larger variety of food
      groups than obese patients, with the diets of non-obese individuals closer to the
      traditional Japanese diet characterized by fish, seaweed, and soybeans/soy
      products. Among 21 food groups, low vegetable intake and high sweets intake were 
      the most strongly associated with obesity in both men and women. Low intake of
      both fruits and vegetables and the combination of high intake of sweets and low
      intake of fruits were associated with obesity. CONCLUSIONS: Food groups and their
      combinations that were strongly associated with obesity in Japanese patients with
      type 2 diabetes were identified. Our findings also suggested an inverse
      association between the traditional Japanese diet and obesity.

TI  - Advanced Glycation End Products Are Associated with Diabetes Status and Physical 
      Functions in Patients with Cardiovascular Disease.
LID - 3032 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu14153032 [doi]
AB  - Advanced glycated end products (AGEs) accumulate systemically and cause diabetes 
      complications. However, whether noninvasive measurable AGEs are associated with
      diabetes status and physical functions remains unclear. One hundred and ten
      patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) who underwent outpatient cardiac
      rehabilitation were included. AGEs scores, using AGEs sensors, were evaluated
      concomitantly with a physical evaluation, including testing the isometric knee
      extension strength (IKES) and 6 min walking distance (6MWD). Thirty-three (30%)
      patients had a history of diabetes mellitus (DM). The AGEs score was not
      different in the presence of DM history (0.52 +/- 0.09 vs. 0.51 +/- 0.09, p =
      0.768) and was not correlated with blood glucose (r = 0.001, p = 0.995). The AGEs
      score was positively correlated with hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c, r = 0.288, p = 0.004)
      and negatively correlated with physical functions (IKES, r = -0.243, p = 0.011;
      6MWD, r = -0.298, p = 0.002). The multivariate analysis demonstrated that 6MWD
      was independently associated with a high AGEs score (&gt;0.52). The AGEs score
      was associated with HbA1c, IKES, and 6MWD in patients with CVD. The AGEs score
      might be a useful indicator for evaluating not only glycemic control but also
      physical functions.

TI  - The Longitudinal Assessment of Vascular Parameters of the Retina and Their
      Correlations with Systemic Characteristics in Type 2 Diabetes-A Pilot Study.
LID - 45 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/vision6030045 [doi]
AB  - The aim of the study was to assess various retinal vessel parameters of diabetes 
      mellitus (DM) patients and their correlations with systemic factors in type 2 DM.
      A retrospective exploratory study in which 21 pairs of baseline and follow-up
      images of patients affected by DM were randomly chosen from the Sankara
      Nethralaya-Diabetic Retinopathy Study (SN DREAMS) I and II datasets. Patients'
      fundus was photographed, and the diagnosis was made based on Klein
      classification. Vessel thickness parameters were generated using a web-based
      retinal vascular analysis platform called VASP. The thickness changes between the
      baseline and follow-up images were computed and normalized with the actual
      thicknesses of baseline images. The majority of parameters showed 10~20% changes 
      over time. Vessel width in zone C for the second vein was significantly reduced
      from baseline to follow-up, which showed positive correlations with systolic
      blood pressure and serum high-density lipoproteins. Fractal dimension for all
      vessels in zones B and C and fractal dimension for vein in zones A, B and C
      showed a minimal increase from baseline to follow-up, which had a linear
      relationship with diastolic pressure, mean arterial pressure, serum triglycerides
      (p &lt; 0.05). Lacunarity for all vessels and veins in zones A, B and C showed a 
      minimal decrease from baseline to follow-up which had a negative correlation with
      pulse pressure and positive correlation with serum triglycerides (p &lt; 0.05).
      The vessel widths for the first and second arteries significantly increased from 
      baseline to follow-up and had an association with high-density lipoproteins,
      glycated haemoglobin A1C, serum low-density lipoproteins and total serum
      cholesterol. The central reflex intensity ratio for the second artery was
      significantly decreased from baseline to follow-up, and positive correlations
      were noted with serum triglyceride, serum low-density lipoproteins and total
      serum cholesterol. The coefficients for branches in zones B and C artery and the 
      junctional exponent deviation for the artery in zone A decreased from baseline to
      follow-up showed positive correlations with serum triglycerides, serum
      low-density lipoproteins and total serum cholesterol. Identifying early
      microvascular changes in diabetic patients will allow for earlier intervention,
      improve visual outcomes and prevent vision loss.

TI  - Barriers Associated with Access to Prescription Medications in Patients Diagnosed
      with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Treated at Federally Qualified Health Centers.
LID - 79 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/pharmacy10040079 [doi]
AB  - This study describes access to prescription medications and examines personal,
      financial, and structural barriers associated with access to prescription
      medications in patients with type 2 diabetes treated at Federally Qualified
      Health Centers. We used a cross-sectional design to analyze data retrieved from
      the 2014 Health Center Patient Survey. Adult participants who self-reported
      having type 2 diabetes were included in this study. Predictor variables were
      categorized into personal, financial, and structural barriers. Outcomes include
      being unable to get and delayed in getting prescription medications. Chi-square
      and multivariable regression models were conducted to examine associations
      between predictor and outcome variables. A total of 1097 participants with type 2
      diabetes were included in analyses. Approximately 29% of participants were
      delayed, and 24% were unable to get medications. Multivariable regression results
      showed that personal barriers, such as federal poverty level, health status, and 
      psychological distress were associated with being unable to get medications.
      Financial barriers including out-of-pocket medication cost and employment were
      associated with access to prescription medications. Type of health center funding
      program as a structural barrier was associated with access to medications. In
      conclusion, multi-level tailored strategies and policy changes are needed to
      address these barriers to improve access to prescription medications and health
      outcomes in underserved patient populations.

TI  - Extended Spectrum beta-Lactamase Producing Lactose Fermenting Bacteria Colonizing
      Children with Human Immunodeficiency Virus, Sickle Cell Disease and Diabetes
      Mellitus in Mwanza City, Tanzania: A Cross-Sectional Study.
LID - 144 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/tropicalmed7080144 [doi]
AB  - Rectal carriage of extended spectrum beta-lactamase-lactose fermenters (ESBL-LF) 
      is the major risk factor for the development of subsequent endogenous infections.
      This study determined the patterns and factors associated with the rectal
      carriage of ESBL-LF among children with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV),
      Diabetes Mellitus (DM), and Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) attending clinics at
      different health care facilities in the city of Mwanza, Tanzania. A
      cross-sectional study was conducted among children living with HIV (n = 236), DM 
      (n = 42) and SCD (n = 126) between July and September 2021. Socio-demographic and
      clinical data were collected using a structured questionnaire. Rectal swabs/stool
      samples were collected and processed to detect the rectal carriage of ESBL-LF
      following laboratory standard operating procedures (SOPs). Descriptive
      statistical analysis was conducted using STATA 13.0. The overall prevalence of
      ESBL-LF carriage was 94/404 (23.3%). Significantly higher resistance was observed
      to ampicillin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and tetracycline among
      Enterobacteriaceae isolated from HIV infected children than in non-HIV infected
      children (p &lt; 0.05). The commonest ESBL allele 45/62 (72.6%) detected was
      blaCTX-M. Generally, a parent's low education level was found to be associated
      with ESBL-LF colonization among children living with HIV; (OR 4.60 [95%CI]
      [1.04-20], p = 0.044). A higher proportion of ESBL-LF from DM 10/10 (100%)
      carried ESBL genes than ESBL-LF from HIV 37/56 (66.1%) and SCD 15/28 (53.6%), p =

TI  - Increased Presentation of Diabetic Ketoacidosis and Changes in Age and Month of
      Type 1 Diabetes at Onset during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Spain.
LID - 4338 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/jcm11154338 [doi]
AB  - Objective: To assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown measures on
      the presenting characteristics (age at diagnosis, severity, monthly distribution)
      of newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes in Spanish children. Research Design and
      Methods: An ambispective observational multicenter study was conducted in nine
      Spanish tertiary-level hospitals between January 2015 and March 2021. Inclusion
      criteria: new cases of type 1 diabetes in children (0-14 years) recording age,
      sex, date of diagnosis, presence of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) at onset, and
      severity of DKA. Data were compared before and during the pandemic. Results: We
      registered 1444 new cases of type 1 diabetes in children: 1085 in the
      pre-pandemic period (2015-2019) and 359 during the pandemic (2020-March 2021).
      There was a significant increase in the group aged </=4 years in the pandemic
      period (chi-squared = 10.986, df 2, p = 0.0041). In 2020-2021, cases of DKA
      increased significantly by 12% (95% CI: 7.2-20.4%), with a higher percentage of
      moderate and severe DKA, although this increase was not significant. In 2020,
      there was a sharp decrease in the number of cases in March, with a progressive
      increase from May through November, higher than in the same months of the period 
      2015-2019, highlighting the increase in the number of cases in June, September,
      and November. The first three months of 2021 showed a different trend to that
      observed both in the years 2015-2019 and in 2020, with a marked increase in the
      number of cases. Conclusions: A change in monthly distribution was described,
      with an increase in DKA at onset of type 1 diabetes. No differences were found in
      severity, although there were differences in the age distribution, with an
      increase in the number of cases in children under 4 years of age.

TI  - The Dynamic Characteristics of Myocardial Contractility and Extracellular Volume 
      in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Mice Investigated by 7.0T Cardiac Magnetic Resonance.
LID - 4262 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/jcm11154262 [doi]
AB  - Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is associated with a high prevalence of diastolic
      dysfunction and congestive heart failure. A potential contributing factor is the 
      accelerated accumulation of diffuse myocardial fibrosis and stiffness. Novel
      cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging techniques can identify both myocardial 
      fibrosis and contractility quantitatively. This study aimed to investigate the
      dynamic characteristics of the myocardial strain and altered extracellular volume
      (ECV) fraction as determined by 7.0 T CMR in T2DM mice. C57Bl/6J mice were
      randomly divided into T2DM (fed a high-fat diet) and control (fed a normal diet) 
      groups. They were scanned on 7.0 T MRI every 4 weeks until the end of week 24.
      The CMR protocol included multi-slice cine imaging to assess left ventricle
      strain and strain rate, and pre- and post-contrast T1 mapping images to quantify 
      ECV. The ECV in the T2DM mice was significantly higher (p &lt; 0.05) than that in
      the control group since week 12 with significantly impaired myocardial strain (p 
      &lt; 0.05). A significant linear correlation was established between myocardial
      strain and ECV (p &lt; 0.001) and left ventricular-ejection fraction and ECV (p =
      0.003). The results suggested that CMR feature tracking-derived myocardial strain
      analysis can assess functional abnormalities that may be associated with ECM
      alterations in diabetic cardiomyopathy, contributing to the study of diabetic
      therapy effects.

TI  - Does Aerobic plus Machine-Assisted Resistance Training Improve Vascular Function 
      in Type 2 Diabetes? A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized
      Controlled Trials with Trial Sequential Analysis.
LID - 4257 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/jcm11154257 [doi]
AB  - Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic disease characterized by
      hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, and pancreatic B cell dysfunction.
      Hyperglycemia can cause several complications, including nephrological,
      neurological, ophthalmological, and vascular complications. Many modalities, such
      as medication, physical therapies, and exercise, are developed against vascular
      disorders. Among all exercise forms, aerobic plus machine-assisted resistance
      training is widely applied. However, whether this intervention can significantly 
      improve vascular conditions remains controversial. In this study, an electronic
      search was processed for the Pubmed, Embase, and Cochrane libraries for
      randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the efficacy of aerobic plus
      machine-assisted resistance training with no exercise (control) on patients with 
      T2DM. Pulse wave velocity (PWV), the index of arterial stiffness, was chosen as
      primary outcome. The reliability of the pooled outcome was tested by trial
      sequential analysis (TSA). Secondary outcomes included systolic blood pressure
      (SBP) and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). Finally, five RCTs with a total of 328 patients
      were included. Compared with control, aerobic plus machine-assisted resistance
      training failed to provide significant improvement on PWV (MD -0.54 m/s, 95% CI
      [-1.69, 0.60], p = 0.35). On the other hand, TSA indicated that this results till
      needs more verifications. Additionally, this training protocol did not
      significantly decrease SBP (MD -1.05 mmHg, 95% CI [-3.71, 1.61], p = 0.44), but
      significantly reduced the level of HbA1c (MD -0.55%, 95% CI [-0.88, -0.22], p =
      0.001). In conclusion, this meta-analysis failed to detect a direct benefit of
      aerobic plus machine-assisted resistance training on vascular condition in T2DM
      population. Yet the improvement in HbA1c implied a potential of this training
      method in mitigating vascular damage. More studies are needed to verify the
      benefit.

TI  - Progressive, Qualitative, and Quantitative Alterations in HDL Lipidome from
      Healthy Subjects to Patients with Prediabetes and Type 2 Diabetes.
LID - 683 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/metabo12080683 [doi]
AB  - Prediabetes is a clinically silent, insulin-resistant state with increased risk
      for the development of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and cardiovascular disease (CVD).
      Since glucose homeostasis and lipid metabolism are highly intersected and
      interrelated, an in-depth characterization of qualitative and quantitative
      abnormalities in lipoproteins could unravel the metabolic pathways underlying the
      progression of prediabetes to T2D and also the proneness of these patients to
      developing premature atherosclerosis. We investigated the HDL lipidome in 40
      patients with prediabetes and compared it to that of 40 normoglycemic individuals
      and 40 patients with established T2D using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)
      spectroscopy. Patients with prediabetes presented significant qualitative and
      quantitative alterations, potentially atherogenic, in HDL lipidome compared to
      normoglycemic characterized by higher percentages of free cholesterol and
      triglycerides, whereas phospholipids were lower. Glycerophospholipids and ether
      glycerolipids were significantly lower in prediabetic compared to normoglycemic
      individuals, whereas sphingolipids were significantly higher. In prediabetes,
      lipids were esterified with saturated rather than unsaturated fatty acids. These 
      changes are qualitatively similar, but quantitatively milder, than those found in
      patients with T2D. We conclude that the detailed characterization of the HDL
      lipid profile bears a potential to identify patients with subtle (but still
      proatherogenic) abnormalities who are at high risk for development of T2D and
      CVD.

TI  - Diabetes Management after a Therapeutic Education Program: A Qualitative Study.
LID - 1375 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/healthcare10081375 [doi]
AB  - (1) Background: Structured education has been used in patients treated with
      insulin, promoting their ability to adhere to and self-manage their treatment. We
      aimed to know the perception and adherence to the recommendations on the
      management of diabetes in type 1 diabetes patients after participating in a
      therapeutic education program. (2) Methods: A descriptive qualitative study
      followed the Standards for Reporting Qualitative Research guidelines. Patients
      with type 1 diabetes participating in a therapeutic education program were
      recruited from February to April 2022. Semi-structured, in-depth interviews were 
      used, and transcriptions were analyzed using the inductive qualitative content
      analysis method. The final sample consisted of 18 type 1 diabetes mellitus
      patients. (3) Results: A number of patients with type 1 diabetes said that they
      had improved their glycemic control after participating in the therapeutic
      education program. Some patients recognized that the chronic disease and the
      complications complexity generated stress and anxiety. This influenced their
      usual life, at work, and their interpersonal relationships. (4) Conclusions: In
      terms of satisfaction, the majority of patients reported a good perception of the
      quality of the organization, the professionals involved, and the contents of the 
      program. The physical and psychosocial benefits of self-care training have been
      demonstrated.

TI  - Hard Voting Ensemble Approach for the Detection of Type 2 Diabetes in Mexican
      Population with Non-Glucose Related Features.
LID - 1362 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/healthcare10081362 [doi]
AB  - Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) represents one of the biggest health problems in 
      Mexico, and it is extremely important to early detect this disease and its
      complications. For a noninvasive detection of T2DM, a machine learning (ML)
      approach that uses ensemble classification models with dichotomous output that is
      also fast and effective for early detection and prediction of T2D can be used. In
      this article, an ensemble technique by hard voting is designed and implemented
      using generalized linear regression (GLM), support vector machines (SVM) and
      artificial neural networks (ANN) for the classification of T2DM patients. In the 
      materials and methods as a first step, the data is balanced, standardized,
      imputed and integrated into the three models to classify the patients in a
      dichotomous result. For the selection of features, an implementation of LASSO is 
      developed, with a 10-fold cross-validation and for the final validation, the Area
      Under the Curve (AUC) is used. The results in LASSO showed 12 features, which are
      used in the implemented models to obtain the best possible scenario in the
      developed ensemble model. The algorithm with the best performance of the three is
      SVM, this model obtained an AUC of 92% +/- 3%. The ensemble model built with GLM,
      SVM and ANN obtained an AUC of 90% +/- 3%.

TI  - Factors Influencing the Desirability, Acceptability, and Adherence of Patients
      with Diabetes to Telemedicine.
LID - 997 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/medicina58080997 [doi]
AB  - Background and Objectives: Telemedicine solutions have proven their value and
      efficacy in augmenting diabetes care. In addition to the availability of tools
      needed to implement telemedicine solutions for patients with diabetes, the
      patients' desirability, acceptance, and adherence represent major burdens in
      implementing them. The main aim of this research is to evaluate which factors are
      influencing the desirability, acceptance, and adherence of patients with diabetes
      to telemedicine interventions in diabetes care. Materials and Methods:
      QTelemeDiab, a previously validated instrument for assessing patients'
      desirability, acceptance, and adherence to telemedicine in diabetes care, was
      used on 114 enrolled patients with diabetes mellitus, in parallel with
      demographic, socio-economic, disease history, and psychometric data from all
      patients. Results: Left-skewed score distributions were observed for the
      QTelemeDiab total score (median = 166; skewness = -1.738), as well as all its
      components, thus denoting a high desirability, acceptance, and adherence towards 
      telemedicine use. The presence of severe depression was associated with
      significant decreases in the QTelemeDiab score (148 vs. 167; p &lt; 0.001), as
      well as on the desirability sub-score (101 vs. 115; p &lt; 0.001) and adherence
      sub-score (30 vs. 35; p &lt; 0.001). The presence of severe anxiety was
      associated with significant decreases in QTelemeDiab score (150 vs. 166), as well
      as the desirability sub-score (104 vs. 114; p = 0.008) and adherence sub-score
      (30 vs. 34; p = 0.012). Conclusions: There is a high desirability, acceptance,
      and adherence to the use of telemedicine interventions in patients with diabetes,
      both in special and in normal epidemiological settings. The presence of severe
      anxiety decreases the patient's desirability, acceptance, and adherence, while
      the presence of severe depression decreases the patient's desirability and
      adherence to the use of telemedicine interventions in diabetes care.

      Gestational Diabetes Mellitus.
LID - 1315 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/genes13081315 [doi]
AB  - Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) represents carbohydrate intolerance in
      pregnant women. The pathogenesis of GDM is very complex, but abnormalities in
      insulin production and secretion underlie the disease. Potassium channels play an
      important role in insulin production and secretion. The family of potassium
      channels includes (among others) the potassium inwardly rectifying channel,
      subfamily J, member 11 (KCNJ11) and voltage-gated K+ channel (KCNQ1). The aim of 
      the study was to examine the distribution of the KCNJ11 rs5219 and KCNQ1 rs151290
      and rs2237892 gene polymorphisms in women with GDM and pregnant women with normal
      carbohydrate tolerance, to verify whether these polymorphisms are risk factors
      for GDM. This study included 204 Caucasian pregnant women with GDM and 207
      pregnant women with normal glucose tolerance (NGT) from the West Pomeranian
      region of Poland. The diagnosis of GDM was based on a 75 g oral glucose tolerance
      test (OGTT) at 24-28 weeks gestation. There were no statistically significant
      differences in distribution of the KCNJ11 rs5219 and KCNQ1 rs151290 and rs2237892
      gene polymorphisms between women with GDM and pregnant women with normal
      carbohydrate tolerance. Moreover, there were no statistically significant
      associations between the studied genotypes and the selected clinical parameters
      in women with GDM. The results of our study suggest that the KCNJ11 rs5219 and
      KCNQ1 rs2237892 and rs151290 gene polymorphisms are not significant risk factors 
      associated with the development of GDM in our population. There were also no
      differences in the expression of KCNJ11 and KCNQ1 genes in the placenta of women 
      with GDM and normal carbohydrate tolerance. However, an association between
      KCNJ11 gene expression in placenta and APGAR score in newborns was found.

      in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.
LID - 1310 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/genes13081310 [doi]
AB  - Metformin is an oral hypoglycemic agent widely used in clinical practice for
      treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The wide
      interindividual variability of response to metformin therapy was shown, and
      recently the impact of several genetic variants was reported. To assess the
      independent and combined effect of the genetic polymorphism on glycemic response 
      to metformin, we performed an association analysis of the variants in ATM,
      SLC22A1, SLC47A1, and SLC2A2 genes with metformin response in 299 patients with
      T2DM. Likewise, the distribution of allele and genotype frequencies of the
      studied gene variants was analyzed in an extended group of patients with T2DM (n 
      = 464) and a population group (n = 129). According to our results, one variant,
      rs12208357 in the SLC22A1 gene, had a significant impact on response to metformin
      in T2DM patients. Carriers of TT genotype and T allele had a lower response to
      metformin compared to carriers of CC/CT genotypes and C allele (p-value = 0.0246,
      p-value = 0.0059, respectively). To identify the parameters that had the greatest
      importance for the prediction of the therapy response to metformin, we next built
      a set of machine learning models, based on the various combinations of genetic
      and phenotypic characteristics. The model based on a set of four parameters,
      including gender, rs12208357 genotype, familial T2DM background, and waist-hip
      ratio (WHR) showed the highest prediction accuracy for the response to metformin 
      therapy in patients with T2DM (AUC = 0.62 in cross-validation). Further
      pharmacogenetic studies may aid in the discovery of the fundamental mechanisms of
      type 2 diabetes, the identification of new drug targets, and finally, it could
      advance the development of personalized treatment.

TI  - Susceptibility Loci for Type 2 Diabetes in the Ethnically Endogamous Indian
      Sindhi Population: A Pooled Blood Genome-Wide Association Study.
LID - 1298 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/genes13081298 [doi]
AB  - Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a complex metabolic derangement that has a strong
      genetic basis. There is substantial population-specificity in the association of 
      genetic variants with T2D. The Indian urban Sindhi population is at a high risk
      of T2D. The genetic basis of T2D in this population is unknown. We interrogated
      28 pooled whole blood genomes of 1402 participants from the Diabetes In Sindhi
      Families In Nagpur (DISFIN) study using Illumina's Global Screening Array. From a
      total of 608,550 biallelic variants, 140 were significantly associated with T2D
      after adjusting for comorbidities, batch effects, pooling error, kinship status
      and pooling variation in a random effects multivariable logistic regression
      framework. Of the 102 well-characterized genes that these variants mapped onto,
      70 genes have been previously reported to be associated with T2D to varying
      degrees with known functional relevance. Excluding open reading frames,
      intergenic non-coding elements and pseudogenes, our study identified 22 novel
      candidate genes in the Sindhi population studied. Our study thus points to the
      potential, interesting candidate genes associated with T2D in an ethnically
      endogamous population. These candidate genes need to be fully investigated in
      future studies.

TI  - Association of TCF7L2, CASC8 and GREM1 Polymorphisms in Patients with Colorectal 
      Cancer and Type II Diabetes Mellitus.
LID - 1297 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/genes13081297 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of the study is to explore the association between the TCF7L2
      rs7903146, CASC8 rs6983267 and GREM1 rs16969681 polymorphisms in patients
      diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and colorectal cancer. METHODS:
      Sixty individuals were enrolled in this case-control study: thirty with
      colorectal cancer and type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and thirty healthy control
      individuals. Real-time PCR was used to determine the genotypes of TCF7L2
      rs7903146, CASC8 rs 6983267 and GREM1 rs16969681 in patients with CRC and T2DM
      and in patients without T2DM and CRC. The Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was
      determined in the control group for the genotype distribution of every
      polymorphism. RESULTS: People carrying the TT genotype of rs7903146, rs6983267
      and rs1696981 had a significant association with T2DM and CRC. Moreover, the
      people with the TT genotype of rs1696981 had a greater risk for T2DM and CRC (OR 
      = 7, CI 0.397-23.347). CONCLUSIONS: TCF7L2 rs7903146, CASC8 rs6983267 and GREM1
      rs16969681 could be risk factors for the association of T2DM with CRC.

TI  - An Insulin Receptor-Binding Multifunctional Protein from Tamarindus indica L.
      Presents a Hypoglycemic Effect in a Diet-Induced Type 2 Diabetes-Preclinical
      Study.
LID - 2207 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/foods11152207 [doi]
AB  - The objectives of this study were to evaluate the hypoglycemic effect of the
      trypsin inhibitor isolated from tamarind seeds (TTI) in an experimental model of 
      T2DM and the in silico interaction between the conformational models of TTI
      56/287 and the insulin receptor (IR). After inducing T2DM, 15 male Wistar rats
      were randomly allocated in three groups (n = 5): 1-T2DM group without treatment; 
      2-T2DM group treated with adequate diet; and 3-T2DM treated with TTI (25 mg/kg), 
      for 10 days. Insulinemia and fasting glucose were analyzed, and the HOMA-IR and
      HOMA-beta were calculated. The group of animals treated with TTI presented both
      lower fasting glucose concentrations (p = 0.0031) and lower HOMA-IR indexes (p = 
      0.0432), along with higher HOMA-beta indexes (p = 0.0052), than the animals in
      the other groups. The in silico analyses showed that there was an interaction
      between TTIp 56/287 and IR with interaction potential energy (IPE) of -1591.54 kJ
      mol(-1) (+/-234.90), being lower than that presented by insulin and IR: -894.98
      kJ mol(-1) (+/-32.16). In addition, the presence of amino acids, type of binding 
      and place of interaction other than insulin were identified. This study revealed 
      the hypoglycemic effect of a bioactive molecule of protein origin from Tamarind
      seeds in a preclinical model of T2DM. Furthermore, the in silico analysis allowed
      the prediction of its binding in the IR, raising a new perspective for explaining
      TTI's action on the glycemic response.

TI  - Quercetin: A Molecule of Great Biochemical and Clinical Value and Its Beneficial 
      Effect on Diabetes and Cancer.
LID - 37 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/diseases10030037 [doi]
AB  - Quercetin belongs to the broader category of polyphenols. It is found, in
      particular, among the flavonols, and along with kaempferol, myricetin and
      isorhamnetin, it is recognized as a foreign substance after ingestion in contrast
      to vitamins. Quercetin occurs mainly linked to sugars with the most common
      compounds being quercetin-3-O-glucoside or as an aglycone, especially in the
      plant population. The aim of this review is to present a recent bibliography on
      the mechanisms of quercetin absorption and metabolism, bioavailability, and
      antioxidant and the clinical effects in diabetes and cancer. The literature
      reports a positive effect of quercetin on oxidative stress, cancer, and the
      regulation of blood sugar levels. Moreover, research-administered drug dosages of
      up to 2000 mg per day showed mild to no symptoms of overdose. It should be noted 
      that quercetin is no longer considered a carcinogenic substance. The daily intake
      of quercetin in the diet ranges 10 mg-500 mg, depending on the type of products
      consumed. This review highlights that quercetin is a valuable dietary
      antioxidant, although a specific daily recommended intake for this substance has 
      not yet been determined and further studies are required to decide a beneficial
      concentration threshold.

TI  - A Scoping Review on the Reported Evidence and Gaps of the Risk of Diabetes in
      Dyslipidemic Patients under Statin Therapy.
PG  - 565-578
LID - 10.3390/clinpract12040060 [doi]
AB  - With the increasing global burden of dyslipidemia over the past 30 years, it is
      estimated that more than 200 million people worldwide are under statin therapy.
      In India, roughly 25-30% of urban populations and 15-20% of rural populations
      have abnormal lipid levels. Statin, which is deemed to be the gold standard
      lipid-lowering agent, is the first treatment of choice for these patients.
      Although statins at one end are highly effective against dyslipidemiaand
      cardiovascular diseases, at the other end, they cause adverse effects including
      an increased risk of diabetes mellitus. The objective of this study was to
      understand the coexistence of diabetes and dyslipidemia in patients undergoing
      statin therapy. A scoping review was conducted with published articles selected
      from PubMed and Google Scholar. The obtained results were filtered based on
      inclusion/exclusion criteria. Our database search provided a total of 822
      articles, of which 48 were selected for this review, with results concluding that
      statin users are potentially at a greater risk of developing diabetes mellitus
      compared with patients who are not using statins. Although many studies have been
      conducted to ascertain the onset of diabetes mellitus amongst statin users, the
      exact mechanism is not yet precisely established. Future studies are essential
      for identifying the exact cause of diabetes mellitus in statin users.

TI  - Semaglutide in type 2 diabetes with chronic kidney disease at high risk
      progression-real-world clinical practice.
PG  - 1593-1600
LID - 10.1093/ckj/sfac096 [doi]
AB  - Background: Semaglutide [glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor-agonist (GLP-1RA)] has 
      shown nephroprotective effects in previous cardiovascular studies. However, its
      efficacy and safety in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and type 2
      diabetes (T2D) have been rarely studied. Methods: This is a multicenter,
      retrospective, observational study in patients with T2D and CKD with glycosylated
      hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) of 7.5-9.5% treated with subcutaneous semaglutide for 12
      months in real-world clinical practice. The main objectives were glycemic control
      as HbA1c <7% and weight loss >5%. Results: We studied a total of 122 patients,
      ages 65.50 +/- 11 years, 62% men, duration of T2D 12 years, baseline HbA1c 7.57% 
      +/- 1.36% and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 50.32 +/- 19.21
      mL/min/1.73 m(2); 54% had a urinary albumin:creatinine ratio (UACR) of 30-300
      mg/g and 20% had a UACR >300 mg/g. After 12 months of follow-up, HbA1c declined
      -0.73% +/- 1.09% (P < .001), with 57% of patients achieving values <7% and weight
      loss of -6.95 kg (P < .001), with 59% of patients showing a reduction of >5% of
      their body weight. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure decreased -9.85 mmHg and
      -5.92 mmHg, respectively (P < .001). The mean UACR decreased 51% in the group
      with baseline macroalbuminuria (UACR >300 mg/g). The mean eGFR (by the Chronic
      Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration) remained stable. The need for basal
      insulin decreased 20% (P < .005). Only 7% of patients on insulin had mild
      hypoglycemic episodes. Semaglutide was stopped in 5.7% of patients for digestive 
      intolerance. Conclusions: In this real-world study, patients with T2D and CKD
      treated with subcutaneous semaglutide for 12 months significantly improved
      glycemic control and decreased weight. Albuminuria decreased by >50% in patients 
      with macroalbuminuria. The administration of GLP-1RA in patients with T2D and CKD
      was safe and well tolerated.

TI  - Efficacy of the holistic, psychonutritional approach of Centro DAI e Obesita di
      Citta della Pieve in the management of type 2 diabetes among patients with
      obesity and dysfunctional eating.
PG  - 1-11
LID - 10.1007/s40200-022-01085-1 [doi]
AB  - Purpose: Dysfunctional eating is strongly associated with obesity and worsens
      type 2 diabetes (T2DM) outcomes. The aim of this study was to investigate the
      effectiveness of the psycho-nutritional treatment (PNT) of "Centro DAI e Obesita"
      of Citta della Pieve on weight loss and glucose management in dysfunctional
      eaters with obesity and T2DM. Methods: PNT includes psychotherapeutical,
      nutritional, physical and social activities. Subjects with obesity, T2DM and
      dysfunctional eating habits who completed the 8 weeks residential program between
      2010 and 2019 were compared with obese, T2DM, dysfunctional eaters who underwent 
      to a conventional, hospital-based, nutritional treatment (CT). Anthropometric
      variables, glucolipid panel, and body composition were assessed at baseline and
      at the end of the program. Weight and HbA1c were also measured after one year
      from the completion. Results: Sixty-nine patients completed the PNT and reduced
      weight (-7 +/- 3.2%; p < 0.001), BMI (-7 +/- 3.1%; p < 0.001), and triglycerides,
      AST, GGT and ALT (p </= 0.008); glycemic control improved (HbA1c: -1.1 +/- 1.5%, 
      mean fasting glucose: -41 +/- 46 mg/dl, p < 0.001). Eleven% of subjects requiring
      diabetes medications at baseline discontinued the therapy. In the insulin treated
      group (49%), mean daily units were halved (-32.6 +/- 26.0, p < 0.001). At one
      year, weight loss (-6 +/- 7.4%, p < 0.001) and HbA1c reduction (-0.52 +/- 1.4%, p
      = 0.029) persisted. Fifty-five patients completed the CT: HbA1c reduced (p =
      0.02), but weight (-0.6 +/- 3.7%), BMI (-0.7 +/- 3.8%), and insulin units'
      reduction (-2.5 +/- 11.7, p = 0.20) were lower compared to the PNT. Conclusion:
      PNT is effective in improving T2DM management in patients with obesity and
      dysfunctional eating.

TI  - Glycemic Control for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients: A Systematic Review.
PG  - e26180
LID - 10.7759/cureus.26180 [doi]
AB  - Diabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic disorder resulting in hyperglycemia and 
      microvascular and macrovascular complications in individuals globally. Type 2
      diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is highly prevalent and accounts for 90% of patients.
      Maintaining blood glucose concentration is essential to avoid severe
      complications. Glycemic control is the optimal serum glucose concentration in
      diabetic patients. It is necessary to identify factors affecting the glycemic
      control of patients to prevent control and complications. We conducted this
      systematic review to assess the factors affecting glycemic control among type 2
      diabetes mellitus patients. Published literature between the years 2020 to 2022
      was retrieved from PubMed, Science Direct, and Google Scholar using different
      combinations of keywords: T2DM, Glycemic control, Poor, Good, Adequate,
      Inadequate, Factors, Association, and Determinants. All original articles written
      in the English language with full-text available and the value of glycemic
      control defined were included. A total of 1866 studies were retrieved. After the 
      title, abstract, screening, and full-text screening, 12 studies were eligible.
      The prevalence of poor glycemic control was high, and it ranged between 45.2% and
      93% among the studies. The factors associated with glycemic control were
      stratified into four categories: personal or body-related, clinical,
      medication-related, and behavioral factors. There was a high prevalence of poor
      glycemic control in all included studies. The glycemic control was associated
      with various factors; some were related to the patient or medical conditions
      while others were related to the behavior of the patients or the medication
      administrated.

AB  - Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a clinical illness usually linked to a wide range of
      skin manifestations; however, skin, as the greatest organ in the body, has
      received little attention. As a result, this study aimed to detect the prevalence
      and pattern of non-infectious skin disorders among patients with diabetes. This
      study was carried out at the Faiha Specialized Diabetes, Endocrine, and
      Metabolism Center, Basrah Province, Iraq, from September 2020 to September 2021. 
      The data were collected from 347 patients with Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM)
      and Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The exclusion criteria were patients with
      skin changes due to some medications, pregnancy, iatrogenic factors, skin
      infections, established hypo- or hyper-thyroidism, Cushing or adrenal
      insufficiency, pituitary disorders, end-stage renal impairment, malignancy, and
      established rheumatological disease and those who were on chemotherapy. Full
      dermatological examinations and screenings were performed under the supervision
      of a dermatologist expert and all clinically definable cutaneous lesions were
      recorded. The prevalence of skin lesions was estimated at 71.5% in patients.
      Pruritus, xerosis, acrochordon, diabetic dermopathy, acanthosis nigricans, and
      insulin-related lipohypertrophy were the commonest skin lesions reported among
      the patients. The occurrence of skin lesions in diabetic patients was
      proportional to the female gender, duration of disease, obesity, insulin therapy,
      and worse glycemic control. There was a broad spectrum of skin lesions in both
      T1DM and T2DM with corresponding prevalence.

AB  - Diabetes is a category of metabolic illnesses defined by a persistently high
      blood sugar level. This complication is caused by either the pancreas failing to 
      create enough insulin or the body's cells failing to respond correctly to the
      insulin produced. Diabetes, if left untreated, can lead to a slew of health
      issues. Diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar hyperglycemia, and mortality are all 
      examples of acute complications. There are numerous serious long-term
      consequences, including chronic renal disease, foot ulcers, as well as nerve and 
      eye damage. This study aimed to extract carbonic anhydrase (CA) from human red
      blood cells and estimate the activity and specific activity of the enzyme and
      some biochemical parameters, including total protein, albumin, globulin, free
      amino acids, free amino acids/total protein (TP), thiol, thiol/TP, as well as
      carbonyl and carbonyl/TP levels in patients with diabetes complications, compared
      to the healthy subjects; moreover, it was attempted to investigate the
      correlation among the aforementioned variables. This study included 60 blood
      samples obtained from patients with diabetes complications and 40 healthy
      individuals as control. The results revealed a significant (P</=0.05) decrease in
      the TP levels, while the CA activity and specific activity were significantly
      (P</=0.05) increased. Moreover, there was a non-significant (P>/=0.05) increase
      in the free amino levels; however, a significant (P</=0.05) increase was observed
      in albumin, free amino/TP, thiol, thiol/TP, as well as carbonyl and carbonyl/TP
      levels. On the other hand, a significant (P</=0.05) decrease was found in the
      levels of globulin and albumin/globulin ratio (AGR) in the patients, compared to 
      the healthy subjects. The results also indicated a significant (P</=0.05)
      difference in all cases of diabetes mellitus (DM) complications for the measured 
      parameters, except for the TP in DM nephropathy, albumin in cardiovascular
      disease, free amino in neuropathy and cardiovascular disease, and free amino/TP
      in retinopathy that showed a clear non-significant (P>/=0.05) difference in the
      patients' groups, compared to the healthy subjects. The results of correlation
      indicated a significant (P</=0.05) positive correlation among free amino/TP, free
      amino/carbonyl, globulin/TP, and AGR/albumin. However, a significant negative
      correlation was noted between globulin/albumin and AGR/globulin. The results
      revealed that the protein oxidation markers and CA as antioxidant markers may
      play a role in monitoring diabetes complications.

PG  - 277-284
LID - 10.22092/ARI.2021.356465.1846 [doi]
AB  - In prediabetes, blood glucose levels are higher than normal; however, they remain
      below the diabetes threshold. Studies conducted on biomarkers for this disease
      result in controlling diabetes mellitus (DM) or reducing the risk of developing
      complications. Lipid profile parameters are considered important predictors of
      DM. Therefore, this study was conducted on three groups of normoglycemic (n=30), 
      pre-diabetics (n=125), and diabetics (n=30) to recognize the predictive role of
      lipid parameters in the transition from pre-diabetes to diabetes. In this
      experiment, in addition to total cholesterol and triglycerides, very-low-density 
      lipoprotein (VLDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein
      (HDL), triglyceride/HDL ratio, and fasting triglyceride-fasting blood glucose
      (FBG) index were measured. Based on the results, medians for total cholesterol,
      LDL, HDL, LDL/HDL ratio, cholesterol/HDL ratio, and LDL/HDL ratio did not differ 
      significantly across the groups of normoglycemia, prediabetes, and diabetes. For 
      triglyceride, the medians were significantly higher in pre-diabetes and also
      diabetes, compared to normoglycemia (i.e., 127.9 and 129.1 vs. 94.5 mg/dL,
      respectively [P<0.001]). Moreover, the same results were observed in the case of 
      VLDL (i.e., 25.6 and 30.9 vs. 18.9 mg/dL, respectively). The triglyceride/HDL
      ratio significantly increased pre-diabetics and diabetics, compared to
      normoglycemic (2.72 and 2.67 vs. 2.18, respectively). Moreover, the median of the
      triglyceride-FBG index significantly had an increase in pre-diabetics and
      diabetics, compared to normoglycemic (8.89 and 9.38 vs. 8.22, respectively). The 
      importance of triglyceride, VLDL, triglyceride/HDL ratio, and triglyceride-FBG
      index in distinguishing between pre-diabetes and normoglycemia was verified by a 
      receiver operating characteristic curve analysis of the results. Logistic
      regression analysis confirmed the risk effects of the four parameters on
      pre-diabetes and diabetes. Therefore, triglyceride, VLDL, triglyceride-FBG index,
      and triglyceride/HDL ratio are considered promising biomarkers used to predict
      pre-diabetes and DM in the general population.

AB  - Type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic immuno-inflammatory and metabolic
      disease characterized by hyperglycemia and insulin resistance with corresponding 
      hyperinsulinemia. On the other hand, Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a
      neurodegenerative disease involving cognitive impairment, neuronal dysfunction,
      and memory loss. Several recently published literatures suggest a causal
      relationship between T2DM and AD. In this review, we have discussed several
      potential mechanisms underlying diabetes-induced cognitive impairment which
      include, abnormal insulin signaling, amyloid-beta accumulation, oxidative stress,
      immuno-inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, advanced glycation end products, 
      acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase, advanced lipid peroxidation
      products, and apolipoprotein E. All these interconnected mechanisms may act
      either individually or synergistically which eventually leads to
      neurodegeneration and AD.

      Diabetes: A Realist Evaluation.
PG  - 3
LID - 10.5334/ijic.5815 [doi]
AB  - Background: The implementation of models of integrated care for chronic
      conditions is not well understood. We conducted a realist evaluation to determine
      how and why the implementation of the National Diabetes Programme in Ireland
      worked (or not). Methods: Documentary analysis and qualitative interviews with a 
      purposive sample of national stakeholders (n = 19), were used to develop an
      initial theory on expected programme delivery. We refined this theory using
      semi-structured interviews (n = 38) with professionals from different clinical
      disciplines involved in programme implementation. Results: Locally important
      contexts facilitating implementation included staff experience of delivering
      diabetes care, capacity, and familiarity with the intended purpose of new
      clinical posts. The extent to which integrated care was adopted and implemented
      depended on judgements made by professionals working in these contexts;
      specifically, judging the relative advantage of the programme and whether to
      engage in negotiations to legitimize their new roles in diabetes care.
      Conclusions: Our results highlight the need for adequate preparatory work to
      raise awareness of and support new roles to implement integrated care,
      clarification on the core components of new care models, and the development of
      local service infrastructures to support integrated care.

TI  - BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 Vaccine Does Not Impact the Honeymoon Phase in Type 1
      Diabetes: A Case Report.
LID - 1096 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/vaccines10071096 [doi]
AB  - Type 1 diabetes (T1D), which is caused by the autoimmune destruction of
      insulin-secreting pancreatic beta cells, represents a high-risk category
      requiring COVID-19 vaccine prioritization. Although COVID-19 vaccination can lead
      to transient hyperglycemia (vaccination-induced hyperglycemia; ViHG), its
      influence on the course of the clinical remission phase of T1D (a.k.a. "honeymoon
      phase") is currently unknown. Recently, there has been an increasing concern that
      COVID-19 vaccination may trigger autoimmune phenomena. We describe the case of a 
      24-year-old young Italian man with T1D who received two doses of the BNT162b2
      mRNA (Pfizer-BioNTech) COVID-19 vaccine during a prolonged honeymoon phase. He
      experienced a transient impairment in glucose control (as evidenced by continuous
      glucose monitoring) that was not associated with substantial changes in
      stimulated C-peptide levels and islet autoantibody titers. Nonetheless, large
      prospective studies are needed to confirm the safety and the immunometabolic
      impact of the BNT162b2 vaccine in T1D patients during the honeymoon phase. Thus
      far, T1D patients who are going to receive COVID-19 vaccination should be warned 
      about the possible occurrence of transient ViHG and should undergo strict
      postvaccination surveillance.

TI  - Evaluation of Immunogenicity and Safety of Vero Cell-Derived Inactivated COVID-19
      Vaccine in Older Patients with Hypertension and Diabetes Mellitus.
LID - 1020 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/vaccines10071020 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: To evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of the COVID-19 vaccine
      (Vero cell), inactivated, in a population aged >/=60 years with hypertension
      or(/and) diabetes mellitus. METHODS: A total of 1440 participants were enrolled
      and divided into four groups, 330 in the hypertension group, 330 in the diabetes 
      group, 300 in the hypertensive combined with diabetes group (combined disease
      group), and 480 in the healthy population group. Two doses of the COVID-19
      vaccine (Vero cell), inactivated, were administered at a 21-day interval and
      blood samples were collected before vaccination and 28 days after the second dose
      to evaluate the immunogenicity. The adverse events and changes in blood pressure 
      and blood glucose levels after vaccination were recorded. RESULTS: The
      seroconversion rate of the COVID-19 neutralizing antibodies was 100% for all
      participants. The post-inoculation geometric mean titer (GMT) in the four groups 
      of the hypertension, diabetes, combined disease, and healthy populations were
      73.41, 69.93, 73.84, and 74.86, respectively. The seroconversion rates and
      post-vaccination GMT in the hypertension, diabetes, and combined disease groups
      were non-inferior to the healthy population group. The rates of vaccine-related
      adverse reactions were 11.93%, 14.29%, 12.50%, and 9.38%, respectively. No
      serious adverse events were reported during the study. No apparent abnormal
      fluctuations in blood pressure and blood glucose values were observed after
      vaccination in participants with hypertension or(/and) diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: The
      COVID-19 vaccine (Vero cell), inactivated, showed good immunogenicity and safety 
      in patients aged >/=60 years suffering from hypertension or(/and) diabetes
      mellitus.

LID - 10.3390/s22145304 [doi]
AB  - Diabetes mellitus is a chronic condition characterized by a disturbance in the
      metabolism of carbohydrates, fats and proteins. The most characteristic disorder 
      in all forms of diabetes is hyperglycemia, i.e., elevated blood sugar levels. The
      modern way of life has significantly increased the incidence of diabetes.
      Therefore, early diagnosis of the disease is a necessity. Machine Learning (ML)
      has gained great popularity among healthcare providers and physicians due to its 
      high potential in developing efficient tools for risk prediction, prognosis,
      treatment and the management of various conditions. In this study, a supervised
      learning methodology is described that aims to create risk prediction tools with 
      high efficiency for type 2 diabetes occurrence. A features analysis is conducted 
      to evaluate their importance and explore their association with diabetes. These
      features are the most common symptoms that often develop slowly with diabetes,
      and they are utilized to train and test several ML models. Various ML models are 
      evaluated in terms of the Precision, Recall, F-Measure, Accuracy and AUC metrics 
      and compared under 10-fold cross-validation and data splitting. Both validation
      methods highlighted Random Forest and K-NN as the best performing models in
      comparison to the other models.

TI  - An Ensemble Approach to Predict Early-Stage Diabetes Risk Using Machine Learning:
      An Empirical Study.
LID - 5247 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/s22145247 [doi]
AB  - Diabetes is a long-lasting disease triggered by expanded sugar levels in human
      blood and can affect various organs if left untreated. It contributes to heart
      disease, kidney issues, damaged nerves, damaged blood vessels, and blindness.
      Timely disease prediction can save precious lives and enable healthcare advisors 
      to take care of the conditions. Most diabetic patients know little about the risk
      factors they face before diagnosis. Nowadays, hospitals deploy basic information 
      systems, which generate vast amounts of data that cannot be converted into
      proper/useful information and cannot be used to support decision making for
      clinical purposes. There are different automated techniques available for the
      earlier prediction of disease. Ensemble learning is a data analysis technique
      that combines multiple techniques into a single optimal predictive system to
      evaluate bias and variation, and to improve predictions. Diabetes data, which
      included 17 variables, were gathered from the UCI repository of various datasets.
      The predictive models used in this study include AdaBoost, Bagging, and Random
      Forest, to compare the precision, recall, classification accuracy, and F1-score. 
      Finally, the Random Forest Ensemble Method had the best accuracy (97%), whereas
      the AdaBoost and Bagging algorithms had lower accuracy, precision, recall, and
      F1-scores.

      Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase 1B Inhibitors in Type 2 Diabetes Drug Design: A
      Review of the Achievements of This Century.
LID - 866 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ph15070866 [doi]
AB  - Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) dephosphorylates phosphotyrosine residues
      and is an important regulator of several signaling pathways, such as insulin,
      leptin, and the ErbB signaling network, among others. Therefore, this enzyme is
      considered an attractive target to design new drugs against type 2 diabetes,
      obesity, and cancer. To date, a wide variety of PTP1B inhibitors that have been
      developed by experimental and computational approaches. In this review, we
      summarize the achievements with respect to PTP1B inhibitors discovered by
      applying computer-assisted drug design methodologies (virtual screening,
      molecular docking, pharmacophore modeling, and quantitative structure-activity
      relationships (QSAR)) as the principal strategy, in cooperation with experimental
      approaches, covering articles published from the beginning of the century until
      the time this review was submitted, with a focus on studies conducted with the
      aim of discovering new drugs against type 2 diabetes. This review encourages the 
      use of computational techniques and includes helpful information that increases
      the knowledge generated to date about PTP1B inhibition, with a positive impact on
      the route toward obtaining a new drug against type 2 diabetes with PTP1B as a
      molecular target.

TI  - Pharmacogenetics of Metformin Transporters Suggests No Association with
      Therapeutic Inefficacy among Diabetes Type 2 Mexican Patients.
LID - 774 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ph15070774 [doi]
AB  - Mexico has been under official epidemiological alert due to diabetes since 2016. 
      This study presents new information on the frequency and variants of metformin
      transporters OCT1, OCT2, OCT3, ABCB1, and CYP2C9 variants as well. It also
      reports the association with HbA1c control on 103 DMT2 patients. They were
      genotyped through real-time PCR (TaqMan assays) and grouped according to
      treatment: metformin and metformin + glibenclamide. Metformin plasmatic levels
      were determined through mass spectrometry. The analysis of HbA1c showed
      statistical significance across genotypes in polymorphisms rs72552763 (p =
      0.022), rs622342 (p = 0.009), rs1128503 (p = 0.021), and rs2032582 (p = 0.009)
      within the monotherapy group. Bivariate analysis found no association between any
      polymorphism and HbA1c control. Two logistic regression models accounted for two 
      diplotypes in OCT1 and ABCB1, including statistically significant covariates. The
      first model yielded significance in age (p = 0.026), treatment period [p =
      0.001], BMI >/= 25 kg/m(2) (p = 0.043), and combined therapy (p &lt; 0.001).
      There was no association with GAT/GAT of rs72552763 or A/A rs622342 in OCT1. The 
      second model yielded significance in age (p = 0.017), treatment period (p =
      0.001), BMI >/= 25 kg/m(2) (p = 0.042), and combined therapy (p &lt; 0.001),
      finding no association with C/C of rs1128503 or G/G of rs2032582 in ABCB1. Our
      multinomial logistic regression results may benefit future predictive analyses in
      diabetic populations.

      Mellitus and on Perinatal Results.
LID - 2954 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu14142954 [doi]
AB  - GDM is a multifactorial disease, so there is controversy regarding the mechanisms
      involved in its pathogenesis. We speculate whether lifestyle and eating habits
      influenced the appearance and pathogenesis of GDM. To explore this issue, the aim
      of the present study was to analyze maternal diet and lifestyle characteristics
      in early pregnancy and their influence on the development of GDM. The study
      included 103 pregnant women who completed a questionnaire on nutritional
      knowledge, lifestyle and eating habits. Perinatal and biochemical outcomes as
      well as pregestational lifestyle and eating habits were compared between
      normoglycemic women and those who developed GDM. The results obtained showed that
      women who developed GDM had erroneous knowledge regarding nutrition. Consumption 
      of white bread (p = 0.018), added sugars (p = 0.037), legumes (p = 0.025), fish
      (p = 0.014), butter (p = 0.010) and the performance of less physical activity (p 
      = 0.024) correlated with glucose intolerance in pregnant women. In conclusion, we
      found a relationship between dietary and lifestyle habits at the beginning of
      pregnancy and the later diagnosis of GDM.

LID - 2953 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu14142953 [doi]
AB  - Plasma transthyretin may be engaged in glucose regulation. We aimed to
      investigate the association between plasma transthyretin levels and the risk of
      newly diagnosed T2DM and impaired glucose regulation (IGR) in a Chinese
      population. We conducted a case-control study including 1244 newly diagnosed T2DM
      patients, 837 newly diagnosed IGR patients, and 1244 individuals with normal
      glucose tolerance (NGT) matched by sex and age. Multivariate logistic regression 
      analysis was utilized to estimate the independent association of plasma
      transthyretin concentrations with the risk of T2DM and IGR. Plasma transthyretin 
      concentrations were significantly higher in T2DM and IGR patients compared with
      control subjects (p &lt; 0.005). After multiple adjustment and comparison with
      the lowest quartile of plasma transthyretin concentrations, the odds ratios (95% 
      confidence intervals) of T2DM and IGR in the highest quartile were 2.22 (1.66,
      2.98) and 2.29 (1.72, 3.05), respectively. Plasma transthyretin concentrations
      also showed a great performance in predicting the risk of T2DM (AUC: 0.76).
      Moreover, a potential nonlinear trend was observed. Our results demonstrated that
      higher plasma transthyretin concentrations, especially more than 290 mg/L, were
      associated with an increased risk of T2DM and IGR. Further studies are warranted 
      to confirm our findings and elucidate the potential mechanisms.

AB  - Diabetes mellitus has become a troublesome and increasingly widespread condition.
      Treatment strategies for diabetes prevention in high-risk as well as in affected 
      individuals are largely attributed to improvements in lifestyle and dietary
      control. Therefore, it is important to understand the nutritional factors to be
      used in dietary intervention. A decreased risk of diabetes is associated with
      daily intake of millet-based foods. Pearl millet is a highly nutritious grain,
      nutritionally comparable and even superior in calories, protein, vitamins, and
      minerals to other large cereals, although its intake is confined to lower income 
      segments of society. Pearl millet contains phenolic compounds which possess
      antidiabetic activity. Thus, it can be used to prepare a variety of food products
      for diabetes mellitus. Moreover, it also has many health benefits, including
      combating diabetes mellitus, cancer, cardiovascular conditions, decreasing tumour
      occurrence, lowering blood pressure, heart disease risk, cholesterol, and fat
      absorption rate. Therefore, the current review addresses the role of pearl millet
      in managing diabetes.

TI  - Impact of Dietitian-Led Nutrition Therapy of Food Order on 5-Year Glycemic
      Control in Outpatients with Type 2 Diabetes at Primary Care Clinic: Retrospective
      Cohort Study.
LID - 2865 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu14142865 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this retrospective cohort study was to evaluate the effect of 5-year
      follow-up of dietitian-led medical nutrition therapy (eating vegetables before
      carbohydrates) on glycemic control in outpatients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) at 
      a primary care clinic. A total of 138 patients with dietitian-led medical
      nutrition therapy (intervention group) and 104 patients without dietitian-led
      nutrition therapy (control group) were compared for glycemic control, serum
      lipid, blood pressure, and diabetic complications for 5 years. Each patient in
      the intervention group received dietary education focused on food order (eating
      vegetables before carbohydrates) by dietitians. A significant improvement in
      HbA1c after 5 years in the intervention group [8.5 +/- 1.7% (69 mmol/mol) to 7.6 
      +/- 1.1% (59 mmol/mol), p &lt; 0.001] was observed, whereas no change was
      observed in the control group [7.9 +/- 1.2% (62 mmol/mol) to 8.0 +/- 1.2% (63
      mmol/mol)]. Dietary intake of protein, fat, carbohydrates, cholesterol, and salt 
      in the intervention group demonstrated significant reduction, while the intake of
      dietary fiber significantly increased after the dietary education. Simple dietary
      education of 'eating vegetables before carbohydrates' presented by dietitians
      achieved good glycemic control after a 5-year period in outpatients with T2DM at 
      primary care clinic.

TI  - Early-Life Exposure to the Chinese Famine of 1959-1961 and Type 2 Diabetes in
      Adulthood: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
LID - 2855 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu14142855 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The fast-growing literature suggests that the Chinese famine of
      1959-1961 drives current and future type 2 diabetes (T2D) epidemics in China.
      This conclusion may be premature, as many Chinese famine studies have major
      methodological problems. We examine these problems, demonstrate how they bias the
      study results, and formulate recommendations to improve the quality of future
      studies. METHODS: We searched English and Chinese databases for studies that
      examined the relationship between prenatal exposure to the Chinese famine and
      adult T2D from inception to 8 February 2022. We extracted information on T2D
      cases and study populations of individuals born during the famine (famine
      births), before the famine (prefamine births), and after the famine (postfamine
      births). We used random-effects models to compare the odds of T2D in famine
      births to several control groups, including postfamine births, combined pre- and 
      postfamine births, and prefamine births. We used meta-regressions to examine the 
      impacts of age differences between comparison groups on famine effect estimates
      and the role of other characteristics, including participant sex, age, and T2D
      assessments; famine intensity; residence; and publication language. Potential
      sources of heterogeneity and study quality were also evaluated. RESULTS:
      Twenty-three studies met our inclusion criteria. The sample sizes ranged from
      less than 300 to more than 360,000 participants. All studies defined the famine
      exposure based on the participants' dates of birth, and 18 studies compared
      famine births and postfamine births to estimate famine effects on T2D. The famine
      and postfamine births had an age difference of three years or more in all
      studies. The estimates of the famine effect varied by the selection of controls. 
      Using postfamine births as controls, the OR for T2D among famine births was 1.50 
      (95% CI 1.34-1.68); using combined pre- and postfamine births as controls, the OR
      was 1.12 (95% CI 1.02-1.24); using prefamine births as controls, the OR was 0.89 
      (95% CI 0.79-1.00). The meta-regressions further showed that the famine effect
      estimates increased by over 1.05 times with each one-year increase in ignored age
      differences between famine births and controls. Other newly identified
      methodological problems included the poorly assessed famine intensity, unsuitable
      study settings for famine research, and poor confounding adjustment.
      INTERPRETATION: The current estimates of a positive relationship between prenatal
      exposure to the Chinese famine and adult T2D are mainly driven by uncontrolled
      age differences between famine births and postfamine births. Studies with more
      rigorous methods, including age-balanced controls and robust famine intensity
      measures, are needed to quantify to what extent the famine exposure is related to
      current T2D patterns in China.

      Mellitus: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.
LID - 2831 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu14142831 [doi]
AB  - This study was aimed at assessing the efficacy and safety of inositol nutritional
      supplementation during pregnancy for the prevention of GDM. PubMed, Embase,
      MEDLINE, and Cochrane library were systematically searched for randomized
      controlled trails (RCTs) in this field until May 2022. Primary outcomes were the 
      incidence for GDM and plasma glucose levels by oral glucose tolerance test
      (OGTT). Pooled results were expressed as relative risk (RR) or mean difference
      (MD) with a 95% confidence interval (95% CI). Seven RCTs with 1321 participants
      were included in this study. Compared with the control group, 4 g myo-inositol
      (MI) supplementation per day significantly decreased the incidence of GDM (RR =
      0.30, 95% CI (0.18, 0.49), p &lt; 0.00001). It significantly decreased the plasma
      glucose levels of OGTT regarding fasting-glucose OGTT (MD = -4.20, 95% CI (-5.87,
      -2.54), p &lt; 0.00001), 1-h OGTT (MD = -8.75, 95% CI (-12.42, -5.08), p &lt;
      0.00001), and 2-h OGTT (MD = -8.59, 95% CI (-11.81, -5.83), p &lt; 0.00001). It
      also decreased the need of insulin treatment, and reduced the incidence of
      preterm delivery and neonatal hypoglycemia. However, no difference was observed
      between 1.1 g MI per day plus 27.6 mg D-chiro-inositol (DCI) per day and the
      control group regarding all evaluated results. In conclusion, 4 g MI nutritional 
      supplementation per day during early pregnancy may reduce GDM incidence and
      severity, therefore may be a practical and safe approach for the prevention of
      GDM.

TI  - ER-Stress and Senescence Coordinately Promote Endothelial Barrier Dysfunction in 
      Diabetes-Induced Atherosclerosis.
LID - 2786 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu14142786 [doi]
AB  - Diabetes mellitus is hallmarked by accelerated atherosclerosis, a major cause of 
      mortality among patients with diabetes. Efficient therapies for
      diabetes-associated atherosclerosis are absent. Accelerated atherosclerosis in
      diabetic patients is associated with reduced endothelial thrombomodulin (TM)
      expression and impaired activated protein C (aPC) generation. Here, we directly
      compared the effects of high glucose and oxidized LDL, revealing that high
      glucose induced more pronounced responses in regard to maladaptive unfolded
      protein response (UPR), senescence, and vascular endothelial cell barrier
      disruption. Ex vivo, diabetic ApoE(-/-) mice displayed increased levels of
      senescence and UPR markers within atherosclerotic lesions compared with
      nondiabetic ApoE(-/-) mice. Activated protein C pretreatment maintained barrier
      permeability and prevented glucose-induced expression of senescence and UPR
      markers in vitro. These data suggest that high glucose-induced maladaptive UPR
      and associated senescence promote vascular endothelial cell dysfunction,
      which-however-can be reversed by aPC. Taken together, current data suggest that
      reversal of glucose-induced vascular endothelial cell dysfunction is feasible.

TI  - Molecular Docking and Dynamics Simulation of Natural Compounds from Betel Leaves 
      (Piper betle L.) for Investigating the Potential Inhibition of Alpha-Amylase and 
      Alpha-Glucosidase of Type 2 Diabetes.
LID - 4526 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/molecules27144526 [doi]
AB  - Piper betle L. is widely distributed and commonly used medicinally important
      herb. It can also be used as a medication for type 2 diabetes patients. In this
      study, compounds of P. betle were screened to investigate the inhibitory action
      of alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase against type 2 diabetes through molecular 
      docking, molecular dynamics simulation, and ADMET (absorption, distribution,
      metabolism, excretion, and toxicity) analysis. The molecule
      apigenin-7-O-glucoside showed the highest binding affinity among 123 (one hundred
      twenty-three) tested compounds. This compound simultaneously bound with the
      two-target proteins alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase, with high molecular
      mechanics-generalized born surface area (MM/GBSA) values (DeltaG Bind = -45.02
      kcal mol(-1) for alpha-amylase and -38.288 for alpha-glucosidase) compared with
      control inhibitor acarbose, which had binding affinities of -36.796 kcal mol(-1) 
      for alpha-amylase and -29.622 kcal mol(-1) for alpha-glucosidase. The
      apigenin-7-O-glucoside was revealed to be the most stable molecule with the
      highest binding free energy through molecular dynamics simulation, indicating
      that it could compete with the inhibitors' native ligand. Based on ADMET
      analysis, this phytochemical exhibited a wide range of physicochemical,
      pharmacokinetic, and drug-like qualities and had no significant side effects,
      making them prospective drug candidates for type 2 diabetes. Additional in vitro,
      in vivo, and clinical investigations are needed to determine the precise efficacy
      of drugs.

TI  - Statistical Bioinformatics to Uncover the Underlying Biological Mechanisms That
      Linked Smoking with Type 2 Diabetes Patients Using Transcritpomic and GWAS
      Analysis.
LID - 4390 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/molecules27144390 [doi]
AB  - Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a chronic metabolic disease defined by insulin
      insensitivity corresponding to impaired insulin sensitivity, decreased insulin
      production, and eventually failure of beta cells in the pancreas. There is a
      30-40 percent higher risk of developing T2D in active smokers. Moreover, T2D
      patients with active smoking may gradually develop many complications. However,
      there is still no significant research conducted to solve the issue. Hence, we
      have proposed a highthroughput network-based quantitative pipeline employing
      statistical methods. Transcriptomic and GWAS data were analysed and obtained from
      type 2 diabetes patients and active smokers. Differentially Expressed Genes
      (DEGs) resulted by comparing T2D patients' and smokers' tissue samples to those
      of healthy controls of gene expression transcriptomic datasets. We have found 55 
      dysregulated genes shared in people with type 2 diabetes and those who smoked, 27
      of which were upregulated and 28 of which were downregulated. These identified
      DEGs were functionally annotated to reveal the involvement of cell-associated
      molecular pathways and GO terms. Moreover, protein-protein interaction analysis
      was conducted to discover hub proteins in the pathways. We have also identified
      transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulators associated with T2D and
      smoking. Moreover, we have analysed GWAS data and found 57 common biomarker genes
      between T2D and smokers. Then, Transcriptomic and GWAS analyses are compared for 
      more robust outcomes and identified 1 significant common gene, 19 shared
      significant pathways and 12 shared significant GOs. Finally, we have discovered
      protein-drug interactions for our identified biomarkers.

TI  - A Serum Metabolite Classifier for the Early Detection of Type 2 Diabetes
      Mellitus-Positive Hepatocellular Cancer.
LID - 610 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/metabo12070610 [doi]
AB  - Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has been identified as an independent risk factor
      for hepatocellular cancer (HCC). However, there are no ideal biomarkers for the
      surveillance and early detection of HCC in the T2DM population at present. In
      this study, we aimed to explore novel metabolite biomarkers for T2DM-positive
      [T2DM(+)] HCC by metabolomic analysis. At first, many serum metabolites were
      found dysregulated in T2DM(+) HCC patients in untargeted metabolomic analyses.
      Targeted metabolite analyses confirmed that serum benzoic acid and citrulline
      were increased, and creatine was decreased in T2DM(+) HCC compared to the T2DM
      group. A metabolite classifier including benzoic acid, creatine, and citrulline
      was identified as a novel biomarker for the diagnosis of T2DM(+) HCC, with an
      area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.93 for discriminating T2DM(+) HCC patients
      from T2DM patients. In addition, the metabolite classifier detected small-size
      (AUC = 0.94), early-stage (AUC = 0.94), and AFP-negative (AUC = 0.96) tumors with
      high sensitivity and specificity. The combination of this metabolite classifier
      and AFP might be useful in the surveillance and early detection of HCC in the
      T2DM population. In conclusion, this study establishes a novel diagnostic tool
      for T2DM(+) HCC.

TI  - Human Serum Metabolites as Potential Mediators from Type 2 Diabetes and Obesity
      to COVID-19 Severity and Susceptibility: Evidence from Mendelian Randomization
      Study.
LID - 598 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/metabo12070598 [doi]
AB  - Obesity, type 2 diabetes (T2D), and severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
      are closely associated. The aim of this study was to elucidate the casual and
      mediating relationships of human serum metabolites on the pathways from
      obesity/T2D to COVID-19 using Mendelian randomization (MR) techniques. We
      performed two-sample MR to study the causal effects of 309 metabolites on
      COVID-19 severity and susceptibility, based on summary statistics from
      genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of metabolites (n = 7824), COVID-19
      phenotypes (n = 2,586,691), and obesity (n = 322,154)/T2D traits (n = 898,130).
      We conducted two-sample network MR analysis to determine the mediating
      metabolites on the causal path from obesity/T2D to COVID-19 phenotypes. We used
      multivariable MR analysis (MVMR) to discover causal metabolites independent of
      body mass index (BMI). Our MR analysis yielded four causal metabolites that
      increased the risk of severe COVID-19, including 2-stearoylglycerophosphocholine 
      (OR 2.15; 95% CI 1.48-3.11), decanoylcarnitine (OR 1.32; 95% CI 1.17-1.50),
      thymol sulfate (OR 1.20; 95% CI 1.10-1.30), and bradykinin-des-arg(9) (OR 1.09;
      95% CI 1.05-1.13). One significant mediator, gamma-glutamyltyrosine, lay on the
      causal path from T2D/obesity to severe COVID-19, with 16.67% (0.64%, 32.70%) and 
      6.32% (1.76%, 10.87%) increased risk, respectively, per one-standard deviation
      increment of genetically predicted T2D and BMI. Our comprehensive MR analyses
      identified credible causative metabolites, mediators of T2D and obesity, and
      obesity-independent causative metabolites for severe COVID-19. These biomarkers
      provide a novel basis for mechanistic studies for risk assessment,
      prognostication, and therapeutic purposes in COVID-19.

TI  - Effect of Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy on HbA1C Level in Children with Type 2 
      Diabetes Mellitus.
LID - 959 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/medicina58070959 [doi]
AB  - Background and Objectives: A third of the American adult population is currently 
      pre-diabetic/morbidly obese and is, therefore, at an elevated risk for developing
      type 2 diabetes. Unfortunately, such a condition does not spare children from
      also developing morbid obesity, where incidence rates of childhood
      obesity-coupled with type 2 diabetes-are markedly elevated. Laparoscopic sleeve
      gastrectomy (LSG) is gradually becoming the novel benchmark in bariatric surgery 
      for the treatment of morbid obesity and associated co-morbidities, also within
      pediatric cases. However, no comprehensive study has been conducted in children
      that emphasizes the effect of LSG on HbA1C levels within such a patient
      population suffering from type 2 diabetes. Aim: Since HbA1C is a major biomarker 
      for type 2 diabetes progression, this study aimed to identify any dysregulated
      serum levels for this key molecular player (together with other parameters), for 
      post-surgical monitoring of the beneficial metabolic effects of LSG surgery on
      type 2 diabetes amelioration/remission within pediatric patients. Materials and
      Methods: A total of 64 pediatric patients, ranging in age from 5 to 14 years old,
      were enrolled in this retrospective study. Multiple laboratory-based analyses
      datasets were also collected from individual study participants, including HbA1C 
      and random blood sugar (RBS). All participating patients were designated for
      undergoing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy, as per standardized surgical
      protocols and each participant was followed-up for two years post-surgery.
      Laboratory investigations were re-performed in order to identify any major
      variations in clinical parameters. Results: HbA1c was significantly reduced among
      children, from 6.0 +/- 0.8 (pre-LSG) to 5.4 +/- 0.4 post-surgery, with a
      reduction rate of 10.9% (p = 0.001). Furthermore, RBS significantly decreased
      from 102.9 +/- 34.0 (pre-LSG) to 87.1 +/- 17.3 post- surgery, with a reduction
      rate of 15.4% (p = 0.036). Conclusions: This study provides further concrete
      evidence for the beneficial metabolic influence provided by LSG surgery on
      morbidly obese, childhood-aged patient populations, with effectiveness in
      reducing co-morbidity progress, in the form of type 2 diabetes, through the
      reduction in HbA1c levels within such patients post-surgery.

      Tomography and Image Binarization.
LID - 918 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/medicina58070918 [doi]
AB  - Background and Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate choroidal
      structure and vascularity indices in patients with non-proliferative diabetic
      retinopathy (NPDR). Materials and Methods: Sixty-three eyes from sixty-three
      patients were evaluated: 21 from healthy subjects, 20 with diabetes mellitus (DM)
      and no diabetic retinopathy (DR), and 22 with DM and non-proliferative diabetic
      retinopathy without diabetic macular edema (DME). Each patient underwent ocular
      examination, macular swept-source ocular coherence tomography (SS-OCT) imaging,
      glycemic control, and systemic high blood pressure (HBP) evaluation. Subfoveal
      choroidal thickness (SF-CT) was manually assessed on a line scan. Line scan OCT
      images were exported to ImageJ program. The areas under a 1.5, 3 and 6 mm
      horizontal line centered on the fovea were assessed by converting the OCT images 
      to binary images, and total choroidal area (TCA), luminal area (LA), stromal area
      (SA), LA:SA ratio, and choroidal vascularity index (CVI) were evaluated. SF-CT
      and choroidal parameters were compared between groups, and correlations with
      ocular and systemic factors were analyzed. Results: SF-CT, TCA, LA, and SA were
      similar between groups. CVIs were significantly different between groups for all 
      three studied areas (CVI-1.5: 66.21% vs. 66.06% vs. 63.74%, p = 0.003; CVI-3:
      65.88% vs. 66.46% vs. 63.79%, p = 0.008; CVI-6: 64.79% vs. 65.40% vs. 63.61%, p =
      0.032). NPDR patients had significantly lower CVIs compared to DM patients (p
      &lt; 0.05). No association of choroidal parameters with glycemic control, DM
      duration and HBP was found significant (p &lt; 0.05). Conclusions: Choroidal
      assessment by SS-OCT and image binarization in healthy subjects, subjects with DM
      without DR, and subjects with DM and NPDR indicated that CVI changes were
      identifiable and significant in early DR. The lack of association with ocular and
      systemic factors suggest that CVIs are reliable assessment parameters of
      choroidal vascular structure.

TI  - TyG Index Performs Better Than HOMA-IR in Chinese Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus with a
      BMI &lt; 35 kg/m(2): A Hyperglycemic Clamp Validated Study.
LID - 876 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/medicina58070876 [doi]
AB  - Background and objectives: Chinese type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients are
      characterized by a low body mass index (BMI), and significant insulin resistance 
      (IR). The triglyceride glucose (TyG) index has not been studied as a means of
      assessing IR in Chinese T2DM patients with a BMI &lt; 35 kg/m(2). Materials and
      Methods: An open-label cross-sectional study recruited 102 Chinese T2DM patients 
      with a BMI &lt; 35 kg/m(2). The hyper-insulinemic euglycemic clamp, homeostatic
      model assessment of IR (HOMA-IR), and TyG index were used to determine the level 
      of IR. Based on Pearson's correlations, glucose disposal rate (GDR), TyG index,
      and HOMA-IR were analyzed. HOMA-IR and TyG index for IR were evaluated using
      multiple linear regression and multivariate logistic regression analyses. On the 
      basis of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, the sensitivity,
      specificity, and optimal cut-off value of HOMA-IR and the TyG index were
      determined. Results: The mean values of GDR, HOMA-IR, and TyG index were 4.25 +/-
      1.81, 8.05 +/- 7.98, and 8.12 +/- 0.86 mg/kg/min, respectively. Pearson's
      correlation coefficient was -0.418 between GDR and TyG index and -0.324 between
      GDR and HOMA-IR. ROC curve analysis showed that, among both sexes, the TyG index 
      was a better discriminator of IR than HOMA-IR. The area under the ROC curve (AUC)
      of the TyG index (0.785, 0.691-0.879) was higher than that of HOMA-IR (0.73,
      0.588-0.873) in all genders. The optimal cut-off values of the TyG index and
      HOMA-IR were 7.99 and 3.39, respectively. Conclusions: The TyG index showed more 
      effectiveness in identifying IR in Chinese T2DM patients with a BMI &lt; 35
      kg/m(2) compared to HOMA-IR.

TI  - Diabetes Mellitus and Other Predictors for the Successful Treatment of Metastatic
      Colorectal Cancer: A Retrospective Study.
LID - 872 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/medicina58070872 [doi]
AB  - Background and Objectives: In the last decades there has been an increasing body 
      of research identifying the positive correlation between diabetes mellitus (DM)
      and solid malignancies, moreover, having shown DM as an independent risk factor
      for colorectal cancer (CRC). The aim of the present study was to assess the
      impact of DM on metastatic CRC (mCRC), and to identify possible predictive
      factors in the successful treatment of mCRC. Materials and Methods: 468 patients 
      with mCRC were included in this retrospective, observational study. A total of
      8669 oncological treatment cycles related to 988 distinct chemotherapy lines were
      analyzed. Data regarding lines of treatment and blood panel values were obtained 
      from the Oncohelp Hospital database. Results: The presence of DM in male patients
      &gt;70 years was a negative predictor (RR = 1.66 and a p = 0.05). DM seemed to
      have a detrimental effect in patients whose treatment included bevacizumab
      (median time to treatment failure -TTF- 94 days for DM+ cases compared to 114
      days for DM-patients, p = 0.07). Analysis of treatments including bevacizumab
      based on DM status revealed lower values of mean TTF in DM+ female patients
      versus DM-(81.08 days versus 193.09 days, p &lt; 0.001). It was also observed
      that DM+ patients had a higher mean TTF when undergoing anti-EGFR (epidermal
      growth factor) therapy (median TTF 143 days for DM+ patients versus 97.5 days for
      those without DM, p = 0.06). Conclusions: The favorable predictive factors
      identified were the inclusion of antiangiogenic agents, a higher hemoglobin
      value, a higher lymphocyte count, the inclusion of anti-EGFR treatment for DM+
      patients, a higher creatinine, and a higher lymphocyte count in treatment lines
      that included anti-EGFR treatment. Unfavorable predictive factors were
      represented by the presence of DM in female patients undergoing antiangiogenic
      treatment, neutropenia in male patients, the association of oxaliplatin and
      antiangiogenic agents, and a higher monocyte count in the aforementioned
      treatment lines.

LID - 848 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/medicina58070848 [doi]
AB  - Background and objectives. There is a bidirectional relationship between
      SARS-CoV-2 infection and diabetes mellitus (DM), as people with DM are more
      vulnerable, and SARS-CoV-2 infections worsen the prognosis in these patients. The
      main purpose of the study was to evaluate the application validity of the
      ISARIC-4C score in patients confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Materials and
      Methods. The study included 159 patients previously known to have type 2 DM and
      confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. We analyzed the concordance between 
      the clinical evaluation of the patients and the ISARIC-4C score. Results. The
      mortality rate in hospitalized patients was 25.15%. The mortality risk was higher
      for ISARIC-4C values &gt;14 than in the opposite group (63.93% vs. 31.24%; p &lt;
      0.001). The area under the curve (AUC) of the mortality score was 0.875 (95% CI: 
      0.820-0.930; p &lt; 0.001), correctly classifying 77.36% of the cohort. A cut-off
      value of &gt;14 had a sensitivity of 87.80% (95% CI: 87.66-87.93), specificity
      73.72% (95% CI: 73.48-73.96), positive predictive value 53.73% (95% CI:
      53.41-54.04), and negative predictive value 94.56% (95% CI: 94.5-94.62). The Cox 
      regression model showed that the length of hospitalization (LH) was significantly
      influenced by body mass index, lung impairment, and aspartate aminotransferase,
      increasing the hazards, while lower HbA1c and lower SatO2 significantly decreased
      the hazards. Conclusions. ISARIC-4C score estimates the likelihood of clinical
      deterioration and the mortality risk in patients hospitalized with type 2 DM and 
      positive for SARS-CoV-2, being useful in assessing the prognosis from the onset, 
      as well as in developing therapeutic strategies.

LID - 10.3390/life12071093 [doi]
AB  - Gestation and the neonatal period are crucial periods in infant development. Many
      components of breast milk, including fatty acids, play an important role in
      strengthening the immune system. The aim of our research was to evaluate the
      fatty acid profiles of milk from 69 mothers, including subjects having a normal
      weight, obesity, or gestational diabetes. For the analyses, we used gas
      chromatography (GC) with flame ionization detection (FID) and GC coupled with
      mass spectrometry (GC/MS). The main fatty acids found in breast milk were
      palmitic acid (C16:0; 26-28%), linoleic acid (C18:2; 23-28%), and alpha-linolenic
      acid linoleic acid (C18:3; 15-17%), followed by myristic acid (C14:0; 5-8%),
      lauric acid (C12:0; 4-6%) and stearic acid (C18:0; 4-5%). The average breakdown
      of fatty acids was 50% saturated, 44% polyunsaturated, and 6% monounsaturated.
      Breast milk samples were classified using principal component analysis and linear
      discriminant analysis. Results showed that milk from the two major groups of
      obese and normal body mass index (BMI) could be distinguished with an accuracy of
      89.66%. Breast milk samples of Hungarian and Ukrainian mothers showed significant
      differences based on the fatty acid composition, which variations are
      attributable to the mothers' dietary habits.

TI  - Pathogenesis of Distal Symmetrical Polyneuropathy in Diabetes.
LID - 1074 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/life12071074 [doi]
AB  - Distal symmetrical polyneuropathy (DSPN) is a serious complication of diabetes
      associated with significant disability and mortality. Although more than 50% of
      people with diabetes develop DSPN, its pathogenesis is still relatively unknown. 
      This lack of understanding has limited the development of novel disease-modifying
      therapies and left the reasons for failed therapies uncertain, which is critical 
      given that current management strategies often fail to achieve long-term
      efficacy. In this article, the pathogenesis of DSPN is reviewed, covering
      pathogenic changes in the peripheral nervous system, microvasculature and central
      nervous system (CNS). Furthermore, the successes and limitations of current
      therapies are discussed, and potential therapeutic targets are proposed. Recent
      findings on its pathogenesis have called the definition of DSPN into question and
      transformed the disease model, paving the way for new research prospects.

TI  - Impact of Diabetes Duration on Clinical Outcome in Patients Receiving Rotational 
      Atherectomy in Calcified Lesions in Korea-Results from ROCK Registry.
LID - 993 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/life12070993 [doi]
AB  - There are limited data regarding the clinical impact of diabetes duration for
      patients with heavy calcified coronary lesions. We sought to determine the
      clinical impact of diabetes duration on clinical outcomes in patients with
      heavily calcified lesions who required rotational atherectomy during percutaneous
      coronary intervention (PCI). A total of 540 diabetic patients (583 lesions) were 
      enrolled between January 2010 and October 2019. Patients were classified into
      three subgroups: patients with no diabetes mellitus (non-DM), shorter duration
      (S-DM), and longer duration (L-DM), of which duration was divided at 10 years.
      During 18 months of follow-up-duration, diabetes duration was significantly
      associated with the primary outcome. The incidence rate of target-vessel failure 
      (TVF), the primary outcome, was significantly higher in the L-DM group compared
      with non-DM or S-DM. Among secondary outcomes, any repeat revascularization (RR) 
      was frequently observed in the L-DM compared with other groups. In multivariate
      analysis, the risk of TVF and any RR was 1.9 times and 2.4 times higher in L-DM
      than in non-DM, respectively. This study firstly demonstrated that there is an
      association between a longer DM duration and poor clinical outcomes in patients
      with severe calcified CAD after PCI. More careful monitoring for recurrence is
      needed during follow-up in those patients.

TI  - Effects of Metformin on Bone Mineral Density and Adiposity-Associated Pathways in
      Animal Models with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: A Systematic Review.
LID - 4193 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/jcm11144193 [doi]
AB  - Recently, there have been investigations on metformin (Met) as a potential
      treatment for bone diseases such as osteoporosis, as researchers have outlined
      that type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) poses an increased risk of fractures. Hence,
      this systematic review was conducted according to the 2020 PRISMA guidelines to
      evaluate the evidence that supports the bone-protective effects of metformin on
      male animal models with T2DM. Five databases-Google Scholar, PubMed, Wiley Online
      Library, SCOPUS, and ScienceDirect-were used to search for original randomized
      controlled trials published in English with relevant keywords. The search
      identified 18 articles that matched the inclusion criteria and illustrated the
      effects of Met on bone. This study demonstrates that Met improved bone density
      and reduced the effects of T2DM on adiposity formation in the animal models.
      Further research is needed to pinpoint the optimal dosage of Met required to
      exhibit these therapeutic effects.

TI  - Diabetes Is an Independent Risk Factor for Cancer after Heart and/or Lung
      Transplantation.
LID - 4127 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/jcm11144127 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: De novo cancers are feared complications after heart or lung
      transplantation. Recent data suggest that diabetes mellitus (DM) might also be a 
      risk factor for cancer. We hypothesized that transplanted diabetic patients are
      at greater risk of developing cancer compared to non-diabetic ones. METHODS: We
      reviewed 353 patients post-heart and/or -lung transplantation from our center
      between October 1999 and June 2021. Patients with follow-up &lt;180 days (n = 87)
      were excluded from the analysis. The remaining 266 patients were divided into
      patients who had preoperative DM (n = 88) or developed it during follow-up (n =
      40) and patients without DM (n = 138). RESULTS: The diabetic cohort showed higher
      rates of malignancies in all patients (30.33 vs. 15.97%, p = 0.005) and in the
      matched population (31.9 vs. 16.1%, p &lt; 0.001). There were also significantly 
      more solid tumors (17.9 vs. 9.4%, p = 0.042; matched: 16.6 vs. 9.1%, p = 0.09)
      The presence of diabetes was associated with a 13% increased risk of cancer when 
      compared to non-diabetic patients. New-onset post-transplant diabetes doubled the
      likelihood of cancer development. CONCLUSIONS: Pre-transplant diabetes mellitus
      increases the risk of cancer after heart and/or lung transplantation. However,
      new-onset diabetes after transplantation is associated with a much greater cancer
      risk. This information is relevant for screening during follow-up.

TI  - Safety and Efficacy of Several Versus Isolated Prophylactic Flexor Tenotomies in 
      Diabetes Patients: A 1-Year Prospective Study.
LID - 4093 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/jcm11144093 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: To assess long-term clinical outcomes of patients who underwent
      isolated versus several percutaneous flexor tenotomies for the treatment of toe
      deformities and previous diabetic foot ulcers; Methods: Twenty-three patients
      (mean age 66.26 +/- 11.20, years) who underwent prophylactic percutaneous flexor 
      tenotomies secondary to tip-toe ulcers participated in this 1-year prospective
      study. The study was stratified into two groups for analyses: (1) isolated
      tenotomies patients, and (2) several tenotomies patients (two or more
      tenotomies). Outcome measures were toe reulceration and recurrence, minor
      lesions, digital deformities, and peak plantar pressure (PPP-N/cm(2)) and
      pressure/time Integral (PTI-N/cm(2)/s) in the hallux and minor toes after a
      1-year follow-up period; Results: Patients with isolated tenotomies (n = 11,
      35.48%) showed a higher rate of reulceration (n = 8, 72.7%, p &lt; 0.001) in the 
      adjacent toes, additionally, we found more prevalence of hyperkeratosis (n = 11, 
      100%), minor lesions (n = 9, 81%), and claw toes (n = 11, 100%) (p &lt; 0.001).
      In several tenotomies patients (n = 20, 64.52%), we found a higher rate of
      floating toes (n = 16, 80%) in comparison with isolated tenotomies patients (p
      &lt; 0.001). PPP and PTI in the non-tenotomy toes were higher in the group of
      patients who underwent isolated tenotomies (p &lt; 0.001); Conclusions: Patients 
      who underwent several tenotomies had better clinical outcomes after a 1-year
      follow-up period compared to isolated tenotomies.

TI  - Retinal Microvascular and Neuronal Changes Are Also Present, Even If Differently,
      in Adolescents with Type 1 Diabetes without Clinical Diabetic Retinopathy.
LID - 3982 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/jcm11143982 [doi]
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate retinal changes in adolescents with
      childhood-onset, long-lasting type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D). Patients and
      healthy controls (HC) underwent optical coherence tomography (OCT) and
      OCT-angiography (OCTA). Individual macular layers, peripapillary retinal nerve
      fiber layer (pRNFL), and vascular parameters (vessel area density (VAD), vessel
      length fraction (VLF) and vessel diameter index (VDI)) of macular superficial
      vascular (SVP), intermediate (ICP), deep (DCP) and radial peripapillary capillary
      plexuses (RPCP) were quantified. Thirty-nine patients (5 with (DR group) and 34
      without (noDR group) diabetic retinopathy) and 20 HC were enrolled. The pRNFL and
      ganglion cell layer (GCL) were thicker in noDR compared to HC and DR, reaching
      statistically significant values versus HC for some sectors. At the macular
      level, VAD and VLF were reduced in DR versus HC in all plexuses, and versus noDR 
      in SVP (p &lt; 0.005 for all). At the RPCP level, VAD and VDI were increased in
      noDR versus HC, significantly for VDI (p = 0.0067). Glycemic indices correlated
      to retinal parameters. In conclusion, in T1D adolescents, retinal capillary and
      neuronal changes are present after long-lasting disease, even in the absence of
      clinical DR. These changes modify when clinical retinopathy develops. The
      precocious identification of specific OCT and OCTA changes may be a hallmark of
      subsequent overt retinopathy.

TI  - Fasting Proinsulin Independently Predicts Incident Type 2 Diabetes in the General
      Population.
LID - 1131 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/jpm12071131 [doi]
AB  - Fasting proinsulin levels may serve as a marker of beta-cell dysfunction and
      predict type 2 diabetes (T2D) development. Kidneys have been found to be a major 
      site for the degradation of proinsulin. We aimed to evaluate the predictive value
      of proinsulin for the risk of incident T2D added to a base model of clinical
      predictors and examined potential effect modification by variables related to
      kidney function. Proinsulin was measured in plasma with U-PLEX platform using
      ELISA immunoassay. We included 5001 participants without T2D at baseline and
      during a median follow up of 7.2 years; 271 participants developed T2D. Higher
      levels of proinsulin were associated with increased risk of T2D independent of
      glucose, insulin, C-peptide, and other clinical factors (hazard ratio (HR): 1.28;
      per 1 SD increase 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.08-1.52). Harrell's C-index for
      the Framingham offspring risk score was improved with the addition of proinsulin 
      (p = 0.019). Furthermore, we found effect modification by hypertension (p =
      0.019), eGFR (p = 0.020) and urinary albumin excretion (p = 0.034), consistent
      with an association only present in participants with hypertension or kidney
      dysfunction. Higher fasting proinsulin level is an independent predictor of
      incident T2D in the general population, particularly in participants with
      hypertension or kidney dysfunction.

TI  - The Impact of the Association between Cancer and Diabetes Mellitus on Mortality.
LID - 1099 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/jpm12071099 [doi]
AB  - The prevalence of cancer, diabetes mellitus (DM), and hypertension is increasing 
      in ageing populations. We analyzed the association of DM with cancer and its
      effects on cancer mortality. The data of 2009-2018 from the Korea National
      Hospital Discharge In-depth Injury Survey were used; 169,959 adults with cancer
      as the main diagnosis were identified. The association rule for unsupervised
      machine learning was used. Association rule mining was used to analyze the
      association between the diseases. Logistic regression was performed to determine 
      the effects of DM on cancer mortality. DM prevalence was 12.9%. Cancers with high
      DM prevalence were pancreatic (29.9%), bile duct (22.7%), liver (21.4%),
      gallbladder (15.5%), and lung cancers (15.4%). Cancers with high hypertension
      prevalence were bile duct (31.4%), ureter (30.5%), kidney (29.5%), pancreatic
      (28.1%), and bladder cancers (27.5%). The bidirectional association between DM
      and hypertension in cancer was the strongest (lift = 2.629, interest support [IS]
      scale = 0.426), followed by that between lung cancer and hypertension (lift =
      1.280, IS scale = 0.204), liver cancer and DM (lift = 1.658, IS scale = 0.204),
      hypertension and liver cancer and DM (lift = 3.363, IS scale = 0.197), colorectal
      cancer and hypertension (lift = 1.133, IS scale = 0.180), and gastric cancer and 
      hypertension (lift = 1.072, IS scale = 0.175). DM increased liver cancer
      mortality (p = 0.000), while hypertension significantly increased the mortality
      rate of stomach, colorectal, liver, and lung cancers. Our study confirmed the
      association between cancer and DM. Consequently, a patient management strategy
      with presumptive diagnostic ability for DM and hypertension is required to
      decrease cancer mortality rates.

TI  - Predicting the 2-Year Risk of Progression from Prediabetes to Diabetes Using
      Machine Learning among Chinese Elderly Adults.

LID - 10.3390/jpm12071055 [doi]
AB  - Identifying people with a high risk of developing diabetes among those with
      prediabetes may facilitate the implementation of a targeted lifestyle and
      pharmacological interventions. We aimed to establish machine learning models
      based on demographic and clinical characteristics to predict the risk of incident
      diabetes. We used data from the free medical examination service project for
      elderly people who were 65 years or older to develop logistic regression (LR),
      decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)
      machine learning models for the follow-up results of 2019 and 2020 and performed 
      internal validation. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC), sensitivity,
      specificity, accuracy, and F1 score were used to select the model with better
      performance. The average annual progression rate to diabetes in prediabetic
      elderly people was 14.21%. Each model was trained using eight features and one
      outcome variable from 9607 prediabetic individuals, and the performance of the
      models was assessed in 2402 prediabetes patients. The predictive ability of four 
      models in the first year was better than in the second year. The XGBoost model
      performed relatively efficiently (ROC: 0.6742 for 2019 and 0.6707 for 2020). We
      established and compared four machine learning models to predict the risk of
      progression from prediabetes to diabetes. Although there was little difference in
      the performance of the four models, the XGBoost model had a relatively good ROC
      value, which might perform well in future exploration in this field.

TI  - Interleukin-35 Prevents the Elevation of the M1/M2 Ratio of Macrophages in
      Experimental Type 1 Diabetes.
LID - 7970 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23147970 [doi]
AB  - Macrophages play an important role in the early development of type 1 diabetes
      (T1D). Based on the phenotype, macrophages can be classified into
      pro-inflammatory (M1) and anti-inflammatory (M2) macrophages. Despite intensive
      research in the field of macrophages and T1D, the kinetic response of M1/M2 ratio
      has not been studied in T1D. Thus, herein, we studied the M1 and M2 macrophages
      in the early development of T1D using the multiple low dose streptozotocin
      (MLDSTZ) mouse model. We determined the proportions of M1 and M2 macrophages in
      thymic glands, pancreatic lymph nodes and spleens on days 3, 7 and 10 after the
      first injection of STZ. In addition, we investigated the effect of IL-35 in vivo 
      on the M1/M2 ratio and IL-35(+) plasmacytoid dendritic cells in diabetic mice and
      in vitro on the sorted macrophages. Our results revealed that the M1/M2 ratio is 
      higher in STZ-treated mice but this was lowered upon the treatment with IL-35.
      Furthermore, IL-35 treated mice had lower blood glucose levels and a higher
      proportion of IL-35(+) cells among pDCs. Macrophages treated with IL-35 in vitro 
      also had a higher proportion of M2 macrophages. Together, our data indicate that,
      under diabetic conditions, pro-inflammatory macrophages increased, but IL-35
      treatment decreased the pro-inflammatory macrophages and increased
      anti-inflammatory macrophages, further suggesting that IL-35 prevents
      hyperglycemia by maintaining the anti-inflammatory phenotype of macrophages and
      other immune cells. Thus, IL-35 should be further investigated for the treatment 
      of T1D and other autoimmune disorders.

TI  - The Problem of Wound Healing in Diabetes-From Molecular Pathways to the Design of
      an Animal Model.
LID - 7930 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23147930 [doi]
AB  - Chronic wounds are becoming an increasingly common clinical problem due to an
      aging population and an increased incidence of diabetes, atherosclerosis, and
      venous insufficiency, which are the conditions that impair and delay the healing 
      process. Patients with diabetes constitute a group of subjects in whom the
      healing process is particularly prolonged regardless of its initial etiology.
      Circulatory dysfunction, both at the microvascular and macrovascular levels, is a
      leading factor in delaying or precluding wound healing in diabetes. The prolonged
      period of wound healing increases the risk of complications such as the
      development of infection, including sepsis and even amputation. Currently, many
      substances applied topically or systemically are supposed to accelerate the
      process of wound regeneration and finally wound closure. The role of clinical
      trials and preclinical studies, including research based on animal models, is to 
      create safe medicinal products and ensure the fastest possible healing. To
      achieve this goal and minimize the wide-ranging burdens associated with
      conducting clinical trials, a correct animal model is needed to replicate the
      wound conditions in patients with diabetes as closely as possible. The aim of the
      paper is to summarize the most important molecular pathways which are impaired in
      the hyperglycemic state in the context of designing an animal model of diabetic
      chronic wounds. The authors focus on research optimization, including economic
      aspects and model reproducibility, as well as the ethical dimension of minimizing
      the suffering of research subjects according to the 3 Rs principle (Replacement, 
      Reduction, Refinement).

TI  - Impact of Metabolic Surgery on Gut Microbiota and Sera Metabolomic Patterns among
      Patients with Diabetes.
LID - 7797 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23147797 [doi]
AB  - Metabolic surgery is a promising treatment for obese individuals with type 2
      diabetes mellitus (T2DM), but the mechanism is not completely understood. Current
      understanding of the underlying ameliorative mechanisms relies on alterations in 
      parameters related to the gastrointestinal hormones, biochemistry, energy
      absorption, the relative composition of the gut microbiota, and sera metabolites.
      A total of 13 patients with obesity and T2DM undergoing metabolic surgery
      treatments were recruited. Systematic changes of critical parameters and the
      effects and markers after metabolic surgery, in a longitudinal manner (before
      surgery and three, twelve, and twenty-four months after surgery) were measured.
      The metabolomics pattern, gut microbiota composition, together with the hormonal 
      and biochemical characterizations, were analyzed. Body weight, body mass index,
      total cholesterol, triglyceride, fasting glucose level, C-peptide, HbA1c,
      HOMA-IR, gamma-glutamyltransferase, and des-acyl ghrelin were significantly
      reduced two years after metabolic surgery. These were closely associated with the
      changes of sera metabolomics and gut microbiota. Significant negative
      associations were found between the Eubacterium eligens group and lacosamide
      glucuronide, UDP-L-arabinose, lanceotoxin A, pipercyclobutanamide B, and
      hordatine B. Negative associations were identified between Ruminococcaceae
      UCG-003 and orotidine, and glucose. A positive correlation was found between
      Enterococcus and glutamic acid, and vindoline. Metabolic surgery showed positive 
      effects on the amelioration of diabetes and metabolic syndromes, which were
      closely associated with the change of sera metabolomics, the gut microbiota, and 
      other disease-related parameters.

TI  - Molecular Effects of Chronic Exposure to Palmitate in Intestinal Organoids: A New
      Model to Study Obesity and Diabetes.
LID - 7751 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23147751 [doi]
AB  - Intestinal cell dysfunctions involved in obesity and associated diabetes could be
      correlated with impaired intestinal cell development. To date, the molecular
      mechanisms underlying these dysfunctions have been poorly investigated because of
      the lack of a good model for studying obesity. The main aim of this study was to 
      investigate the effects of lipotoxicity on intestinal cell differentiation in
      small intestinal organoid platforms, which are used to analyze the regulation of 
      cell differentiation. Mouse intestinal organoids were grown in the
      presence/absence of high palmitate concentrations (0.5 mM) for 48 h to simulate
      lipotoxicity. Palmitate treatment altered the expression of markers involved in
      the differentiation of enterocytes and goblet cells in the early (Hes1) and late 
      (Muc2) phases of their development, respectively, and it modified enterocytes and
      goblet cell numbers. Furthermore, the expression of enteroendocrine cell
      progenitors (Ngn3) and I cells (CCK) markers was also impaired, as well as
      CCK-positive cell numbers and CCK secretion. Our data indicate, for the first
      time, that lipotoxicity simultaneously influences the differentiation of specific
      intestinal cell types in the gut: enterocytes, goblet cells and CCK cells.
      Through this study, we identified novel targets associated with molecular
      mechanisms affected by lipotoxicity that could be important for obesity and
      diabetes therapy.

      Syndrome-Associated Gut Microbiome.
LID - 7509 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23147509 [doi]
AB  - Metabolic syndrome (MetSyn) is a major health problem affecting approximately 25%
      of the worldwide population. Since the gut microbiota is highly connected to the 
      host metabolism, several recent studies have emerged to characterize the role of 
      the microbiome in MetSyn development and progression. To this end, our study
      aimed to identify the microbiome patterns which distinguish MetSyn from type 2
      diabetes mellitus (T2DM). We performed 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing on a cohort
      of 70 individuals among which 40 were MetSyn patients. The microbiome of MetSyn
      patients was characterised by reduced diversity, loss of butyrate producers
      (Subdoligranulum, Butyricicoccus, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii) and enrichment in
      the relative abundance of fungal populations. We also show a link between the gut
      microbiome and lipid metabolism in MetSyn. Specifically, low-density lipoproteins
      (LDL) and high-density lipoproteins (HDL) display a positive effect on gut
      microbial diversity. When interrogating the signature of gut microbiota in a
      subgroup of patients harbouring both MetSyn and T2DM conditions, we observed a
      significant increase in taxa such as Bacteroides, Clostridiales, and
      Erysipelotrichaceae. This preliminary study shows for the first time that T2DM
      brings unique signatures of gut microbiota in MetSyn patients. We also highlight 
      the impact of metformin treatment on the gut microbiota. Metformin administration
      was linked to changes in Prevotellaceae, Rickenellaceae, and Clostridiales.
      Further research focusing on the microbiome-metabolome patterns is needed to
      clarify the exact association of various gut microbial communities with the
      progression of T2DM and the occurrence of various complications in MetSyn
      patients.

TI  - Maintenance of Physical Activity Behavior by Individuals with Prediabetes and
      Diabetes during the COVID-19 Pandemic after Completing an Exercise Intervention
      in Brazil.
LID - 8857 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19148857 [doi]
AB  - This cross-sectional study evaluated the perception of individuals with
      prediabetes/diabetes about their living conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic
      to identify the facilitators, barriers, and reasons to remain physically active
      at home and adhere to recommended exercise. It included individuals with
      prediabetes/diabetes who had completed an exercise intervention, which started
      on-site and moved to a remote home-based regime due to the COVID-19 pandemic and 
      were advised to keep exercising at home. The outcomes were assessed by a bespoke 
      questionnaire that was developed by the research team, the Brazilian Portuguese
      adapted version of the Exercise Adherence Rating scale, and the Motives for
      Physical Activity Measure-Revised scale. Of 15 participants (8 female, 58 +/- 11 
      years), most reported positive perceptions about their living conditions and few 
      difficulties maintaining some physical activity at home. However, only 53.8% of
      them adhered to the recommended exercise. Time flexibility, no need for
      commuting, and a sense of autonomy were the main facilitators of home exercise,
      while a lack of adequate space was the main barrier. The descending order of
      median scores that were obtained in each reason for physical activity was
      fitness, enjoyment, competence, social, and appearance. Individuals with
      prediabetes/diabetes maintained some physical activity during the pandemic,
      mainly motivated by health concerns.

TI  - Prevalence, Management, and Associated Factors of Obesity, Hypertension, and
      Diabetes in Tibetan Population Compared with China Overall.
LID - 8787 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19148787 [doi]
AB  - Tibetans' life expectancy lags behind China's average. Obesity and
      noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) contribute to health disparity, but NCD patterns 
      among Tibetans are unknown. To examine the prevalence, management, and associated
      factors for obesity, hypertension, and diabetes among Tibetans, compared with
      China's average, we systematically searched PubMed and China National Knowledge
      Infrastructure databases for studies between January 2010 and April 2021.
      Thirty-nine studies were included for systematic review, among thirty-seven that 
      qualified for meta-analysis, with 115,403 participants. Pooled prevalence was
      47.9% (95% CI 38.0-57.8) for overweight/obesity among adults (BMI >/= 24 kg/m(2))
      and 15.4% (13.7-17.2) among children using Chinese criteria, which are lower than
      the national rates of 51.2% and 19.0%, respectively. The estimate for
      hypertension (31.4% [27.1-35.7]) exceeded China's average (27.5%), while diabetes
      (7.5% [5.2-9.8]) was lower than average (11.9%). Men had a higher prevalence of
      the three conditions than women. Residents in urban areas, rural areas, and
      Buddhist institutes had monotonically decreased prevalence in hypertension and
      diabetes. Awareness, treatment, and control rates for hypertension and diabetes
      were lower than China's average. Urban residence and high altitude were
      consistent risk factors for hypertension. Limited studies investigated factors
      for diabetes, yet none exist for obesity. Tibetans have high burdens of obesity
      and hypertension. Representative and longitudinal studies are needed for tailored
      interventions. There are considerable variations in study design, study sample
      selection, and data-analysis methods, as well as estimates of reviewed studies.

TI  - The Association between Blood Concentrations of PCDD/DFs, DL-PCBs and the Risk of
      Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Thyroid Cancer in South Korea.
LID - 8745 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19148745 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Epidemiological studies have inconsistently shown an
      association between dioxin and risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and
      cancer. This study aims to examine the effects of blood concentration of
      dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (DL-PCBs) and polychlorinated
      dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/DFs) on T2DM and thyroid cancer.
      METHODS: We conducted a nested case-control study within the Korean cancer
      prevention study-II (KCPS-II) consisting of 15 thyroid cancer cases, 30 T2DM
      cases, and 55 controls. A total of 500 samples were used in 100 pooling samples. 
      An average value of a pooled sample was calculated weighted by the blood volume
      of each sample. RESULTS: The study population included 100 participants from the 
      KCPS-II (median (IQR) baseline age, 54.06 [21.04] years; 48 women). The toxic
      equivalents of PCDD/DFs showed a significant positive association with T2DM and
      thyroid cancer, after adjustments for potential confounders (T2DM ORs = 1.23; 95%
      CI = 1.05-1.43; thyroid cancer ORs = 1.34; 95% CI = 1.12-1.61). CONCLUSION: In
      this study, both T2DM and thyroid cancer were associated with the blood
      concentrations of PCDD/DFs. The association between PCDD/DFs and T2D was found
      among women but not among men. Our findings suggest that further biochemical in
      vivo research and epidemiologic studies are needed to clarify the association
      between dioxins concentrations and diseases.

TI  - Dose-Dependent Proton Pump Inhibitor Exposure and Risk of Type 2 Diabetes: A
      Nationwide Nested Case-Control Study.
LID - 8739 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19148739 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: To investigate the association between proton pump inhibitor (PPI)
      exposure and a risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) among patients with upper 
      gastrointestinal disease (UGID). METHOD: We conducted a case-control study from
      Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database between 1998 and 2013. A
      total of 20,940 patients with T2DM and 20,940 controls were included. The dose of
      PPIs was categorized according to the cumulative defined daily dose (cDDD). The
      risk of T2DM was assessed using conditional logistic regression analysis. RESULT:
      Compared with cDDD </= 30, higher dosage of PPI exposure was associated with an
      increased risk of T2DM development: cDDD 31-120 (odds ratio [OR]: 1.20, 95%
      confidence interval [CI]: 1.13-1.26); cDDD 121-365 (OR: 1.26, 95% CI: 1.19-1.33);
      and cDDD &gt; 365 (OR: 1.34, 95% CI: 1.23-1.46). Subgroup analysis of individual 
      PPI showed that pantoprazole (OR: 1.14, 95% CI: 1.07-1.21), lansoprazole (OR:
      1.08, 95% CI: 1.03-1.12), and omeprazole (OR: 1.11, 95% CI: 1.06-1.16) have a
      significantly higher risk of T2DM development. CONCLUSIONS: A dose-dependent
      increased risk of T2DM was found among patients with UGID using higher doses of
      PPIs compared with those with lower doses of these drugs. Further studies are
      necessary to investigate the underlying pathophysiology of PPIs and T2DM.

TI  - Diabetes and Cardiovascular Diseases Risk Assessment in Community Pharmacies: An 
      Implementation Study.
LID - 8699 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19148699 [doi]
AB  - The implementation of a new service is often challenging when translating
      research findings into routine clinical practices. This paper presents the
      results of the implementation study of a pilot project for a diabetes and
      cardiovascular diseases risk-assessment service in Belgian community pharmacies. 
      To evaluate the implementation of the service, a mixed method was used that
      follows the RE-AIM framework. During the testing stage, 37 pharmacies
      participated, including five that dropped out due to a lack of time or
      COVID-19-related temporary obligations. Overall, 502 patients participated, of
      which 376 (74.9%) were eligible for according-to-protocol analysis. Of these, 80 
      patients (21.3%) were identified as being at high risk for the targeted diseases,
      and 100 (26.6%) were referred to general practice for further investigation. We
      presented the limited effectiveness and the key elements influencing optimal
      implementation. Additional strategies, such as interprofessional workshops, a
      data-sharing platform, and communication campaigns, should be considered to
      spread awareness of the new role of pharmacists. Such strategies could also
      promote collaboration with general practitioners to ensure the follow-up of
      patients at high risk. Overall, this service was considered easy to perform and
      feasible in practice but would require financial and external support to ensure
      its effectiveness, sustainability, and larger-scale implementation.

      Sarcopenia.
LID - 8677 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19148677 [doi]
AB  - The life expectancy of the population is increasing worldwide due to improvements
      in the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases. This favors a higher
      prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in the elderly. Sarcopenia and
      frailty are also frequently present in aging. These three entities share common
      mechanisms such as insulin resistance, chronic inflammation, and mitochondrial
      dysfunction. The coexistence of these situations worsens the prognosis of elderly
      patients. In this paper, we review the main measures for the prevention and
      management of sarcopenia and/or frailty in elderly patients with T2DM.

LID - 8560 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19148560 [doi]
AB  - Adiposity rebound (AR), which is defined as a situation in which the body mass
      index (BMI) starts to increase after infancy, is a predictive marker of future
      development of type 2 diabetes. The patient was a 20-year-old male. He was born
      at 28 gestational weeks with a birthweight of 642 g (-3.20 standard deviation,
      small-for-gestational age [SGA]). AR during early childhood or obesity in later
      childhood was not observed. At the onset of type 2 diabetes (20 years of age),
      his BMI, body fat percentage, and body fat mass were within normal ranges (20.4, 
      18.4% and 10.8 kg, respectively). However, his muscle mass was 44.7 kg, with low 
      muscle mass of the trunk and upper limbs, which was lower than the standard
      reference, indicating that myogenic insulin resistance was involved in the
      development of non-obese type 2 diabetes. This case report describes a patient
      with no presentation of AR and obesity during childhood, who was born extremely
      preterm SGA, developed non-obese type 2 diabetes with low muscle mass. We suggest
      that patients born extremely preterm SGA should be carefully observed for the
      development of type 2 diabetes, even if they did not have AR in early childhood
      or had not become obese.

LID - 8455 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19148455 [doi]
AB  - Southeast Asia harbors a young population of more than 600 million people.
      Socioeconomic transition within the last decades, driven by globalization and
      rapid economic growth, has led to significant changes in lifestyle and nutrition 
      in many countries of this region. Hence, an increase in the number of
      non-communicable diseases is seen in most populations of Southeast Asia. Brunei
      Darussalam is the smallest country in this region, with a population of around
      400,000 inhabitants. Vast hydrocarbon resources have transformed Brunei into a
      wealthy industrialized country within the last few decades. We compared the age
      distribution and prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors in ischemic stroke
      patients between the only stroke unit in Brunei Darussalam and a tertiary stroke 
      center from Frankfurt/Germany. Between 2011 and 2016, a total number of 3877
      ischemic stroke patients were treated in both institutions. Even after adjusting 
      for age due to different population demographics, stroke patients in Brunei were 
      younger compared to their German counterparts. The prevalence of hypertension and
      diabetes mellitus was significantly higher in young age groups in Brunei, whereas
      no difference was observed for older patients. The rapid socioeconomic transition
      might be a significant risk factor for the development of non-communicable
      diseases, including stroke.

TI  - Gestational Diabetes Mellitus: A Cross-Sectional Survey of Its Knowledge and
      Associated Factors among United Arab Emirates University Students.

AB  - Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) burden is burgeoning globally. Correct
      knowledge about GDM among young people is paramount for timely prevention. This
      study assesses GDM knowledge and identifies factors associated with it among
      United Arab Emirates (UAE) University students. A validated self-administered
      questionnaire collected data from the university students. We analyzed the data
      for GDM knowledge status (ever heard of GDM) and GDM knowledge levels (poor,
      fair, and good) and conducted ordinal logistic regressions to assess for
      associated factors. A total of 735 students were surveyed with a mean age of 21.0
      years. Of these, 72.8% had heard of GDM, and 52.9% of males versus 20.3% of
      female students had never heard of the condition before. Higher age (p = 0.019)
      and being a postgraduate student (p = 0.026) were associated with higher GDM
      knowledge status in males. GDM knowledge level analysis showed that 24.0%, 58.5%,
      and 17.5% had poor, fair, and good knowledge. The mean GDM-knowledge score was
      6.3 +/- 2.4 (out of 12). Being married [aOR-1.82 (95%CI 1.10-3.03)] and knowing
      someone who had GDM [aOR-1.78 (95%CI 1.23-2.60)] were independently associated
      with higher GDM knowledge levels among students. Students' primary source of GDM 
      knowledge was family/friends. There is an observed knowledge gap related to GDM
      among the students, especially males. This study urges the need to accelerate
      targeted GDM awareness campaigns among university students and the general
      population in the UAE.

TI  - Physical Activity Evaluation Using Activity Trackers for Type 2 Diabetes
      Prevention in Patients with Prediabetes.
LID - 8251 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19148251 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prediabetes is a reversible condition, but lifestyle-changing
      measures, such as increasing physical activity, should be taken. This article
      explores the use of Fitbit activity trackers to assess physical activity and its 
      impact on prediabetic patient health. METHODS: Intervention study. In total, 30
      volunteers (9 males and 21 females), aged 32-65 years, with impaired glucose
      levels and without diabetes or moving disorders, received Fitbit Inspire activity
      trackers and physical activity recommendations. A routine blood check was taken
      during the first and second visits, and body composition was analyzed. Physical
      activity variability in time was assessed using a Poincare plot. RESULTS: The
      count of steps per day and variability differed between patients and during the
      research period, but the change in total physical activity was not statistically 
      significant. Significant positive correlations between changes in lipid values,
      body mass composition, and variability of steps count, distance, and minutes of
      very active physical activity were observed. CONCLUSIONS: When assessing physical
      activity, data doctors should evaluate not just the totals or the medians of the 
      steps count, but also physical activity variability in time. The study shows that
      most changes were better linked to the physical activity variability than the
      total count of physical activity.

TI  - Genetic Association between Different Metabolic Variants in APOA5 and PLIN1 in
      Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus among the Western Saudi Population: Case-Control Study.
LID - 1246 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/genes13071246 [doi]
AB  - Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a multifactorial disease with a high global
      incidence. Hypertriglyceridemia is a major risk factor for both cardiovascular
      disease and T2DM. In this study, we determined the allele and genotype
      frequencies of apolipoprotein A5 (APOA5) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
      rs662799 and perilipin 1 (PLIN1) SNPs rs894160, rs6496589, and rs1052700 and
      evaluated their association with T2DM risk in western Saudis. Only rs6496589 was 
      found to be significantly associated with T2DM risk. We determined the risk
      allele for each SNP based on relative risk, and found that the G allele of
      rs662799, T allele of rs894160, G allele of r6496589, and T allele of rs1052700
      correlated with T2DM risk. The effect of each SNP on T2DM risk and five of its
      clinical phenotypes was explored using multiple logistic regression. We found
      significant correlations between the C/G and G/G genotypes of rs6496589 and T2DM 
      risk in the unadjusted model, whereas G/G was the only genotype that correlated
      with the risk of T2DM in the adjusted model. There was no significant correlation
      between rs662799, rs894160, and rs1052700 genotypes and T2DM risk. In conclusion,
      we have identified novel risk alleles and genotypes that contribute to genetic
      risk for T2DM in the western Saudi population.

TI  - Overview of Transcriptomic Research on Type 2 Diabetes: Challenges and
      Perspectives.
LID - 1176 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/genes13071176 [doi]
AB  - Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a common chronic disease whose etiology is known to have
      a strong genetic component. Standard genetic approaches, although allowing for
      the detection of a number of gene variants associated with the disease as well as
      differentially expressed genes, cannot fully explain the hereditary factor in
      T2D. The explosive growth in the genomic sequencing technologies over the last
      decades provided an exceptional impetus for transcriptomic studies and new
      approaches to gene expression measurement, such as RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) and
      single-cell technologies. The transcriptomic analysis has the potential to find
      new biomarkers to identify risk groups for developing T2D and its microvascular
      and macrovascular complications, which will significantly affect the strategies
      for early diagnosis, treatment, and preventing the development of complications. 
      In this article, we focused on transcriptomic studies conducted using expression 
      arrays, RNA-seq, and single-cell sequencing to highlight recent findings related 
      to T2D and challenges associated with transcriptome experiments.

AB  - Traditional methods concerning type 2 diabetes (T2D) are limited to grouped cells
      instead of each single cell, and thus the heterogeneity of single cells is
      erased. Therefore, it is still challenging to study T2D based on a single-cell
      and network perspective. In this study, we construct a conditional cell-specific 
      network (CCSN) for each single cell for the GSE86469 dataset which is a
      single-cell transcriptional set from nondiabetic (ND) and T2D human islet
      samples, and obtain a conditional network degree matrix (CNDM). Since beta cells 
      are the key cells leading to T2D, we search for hub genes in CCSN of beta cells
      and find that ATP6AP2 is essential for regulation and storage of insulin, and the
      renin-angiotensin system involving ATP6AP2 is related to most pathological
      processes leading to diabetic nephropathy. The communication between beta cells
      and other endocrine cells is performed and three gene pairs with obvious
      interaction are found. In addition, different expression genes (DEGs) are found
      based on CNDM and the gene expression matrix (GEM), respectively. Finally, 'dark'
      genes are identified, and enrichment analysis shows that NFATC2 is involved in
      the VEGF signaling pathway and indirectly affects the production of Prostacyclin 
      (PGI2), which may be a potential biomarker for diabetic nephropathy.

TI  - Care and Safety of Schoolchildren with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus: Parental
      Perceptions of the School Nurse Role.
LID - 1228 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/healthcare10071228 [doi]
AB  - Schoolchildren with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) need supervision in the
      management of their disorder by the school nurse, securing proper care and safety
      in the school environment. The aim of this study was to investigate the parents' 
      perceptions regarding the care and safety of their children with T1DM at school. 
      In this cross-sectional study, 356 parents of children with T1DM attending
      primary and secondary school (convenience sample) completed the "Parents'
      Opinions about School-based Care for Children with Diabetes" and the "Safety of
      children with T1DM at school". The majority (58.8%) noted that their children
      received some care from a school nurse, less than half (44.6%) declared feeling
      very safe concerning diabetes care, and 42.5% reported high levels of diabetes
      management satisfaction. Younger age of the child (p &lt; 0.001), school nurses' 
      advanced diabetic care skills (p &lt; 0.001), existence of school nurse's office 
      (p &lt; 0.05) and higher educational level of the father were positively
      correlated with higher parental feelings of safety and satisfaction. The presence
      of a school nurse was associated with higher academic performance (p &lt; 0.001),
      significantly fewer absences due to the disorder (p &lt; 0.001) and better
      diabetes management (p &lt; 0.043). The daily presence of a school nurse in
      school decreases absenteeism, greatly improves school performance and enhances
      diabetic management of schoolchildren with T1DM.

TI  - A Systematic Review of Clinical Outcomes from Pharmacist Provided Medication
      Therapy Management (MTM) among Patients with Diabetes, Hypertension, or
      Dyslipidemia.
LID - 1207 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/healthcare10071207 [doi]
AB  - This study aimed to compare the clinical outcomes of pharmacist-provided
      medication therapy management (MTM) services as compared to no MTM services
      (i.e., standard of care) on outpatient clinical outcomes for patients with
      diabetes, hypertension, or dyslipidemia. A systematic literature review of
      PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane library, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts,
      PsycINFO, Scopus, CINAHL electronic databases, grey literature, websites, and
      journals, was conducted from 1 January 2005-20 July 2021. The search field
      contained a combination of keywords and MeSH terms such as: "medication therapy
      management", "pharmacist", "treatment outcomes". Studies published in United
      States, included adults >/=18 years old who received at least one
      pharmacist-provided MTM consultation and at least one group who received no MTM, 
      and reported pre-specified clinical outcomes for diabetes mellitus, hypertension,
      or dyslipidemia were included. Of 849 studies identified, eight were included
      (cohort studies = 6, randomized controlled trials = 2). Clinical outcomes
      improved with MTM interventions, as evidenced by statistically significant
      changes in at least one of the three chronic conditions in most studies.
      Improvements were observed for diabetes outcomes (n = 4 studies), hypertension
      outcomes (n = 4 studies), and dyslipidemia outcomes (n = 3 studies). Overall,
      this study indicated that pharmacist delivered MTM services (versus no MTM
      services) can improve clinical outcomes for patients with diabetes, hypertension,
      and dyslipidemia.

      2 Diabetes.
LID - 1153 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/healthcare10071153 [doi]
AB  - (1) Background. We aimed to assess long-term efficacy and safety in inadequately 
      controlled type 2 diabetes (T2DM) of two SGLT-2 inhibitors: empagliflozin (Empa) 
      and dapagliflozin (Dapa), combined with metformin, other oral antidiabetics or
      insulin, according to the protocols in Romania. (2) Methods. The data of 100
      patients treated for T2DM with associated dyslipidemia and/or cardiovascular
      diseases at the University Hospital and Consultmed Medical Center in Iasi were
      retrospectively reviewed (2017-2021). In total, 48 patients had received
      dapagliflozin (10 mg with oral antidiabetics or insulin) and 52 patients received
      empagliflozin (10 mg /25 mg with oral antidiabetics). (3) Results. In both
      groups, the lowering of BMI was significant: Dapa group (32.04 +/- 4.49 vs. 31.40
      +/- 4.18 kg/m(2); p = 0.006), and Empa group (34.16 +/- 5.08 vs. 33.17 +/- 4.99
      kg/m(2); p = 0.002). Blood sugar average levels decreased significantly (170 vs. 
      136 mg/dL; p = 0.001 for Dapa; 163 vs. 140 mg/dL; p = 0.002 for Empa) and also
      average levels of HbA1c (7.90% vs. 7.51%; p = 0,01 for Dapa; 7.72% vs. 7.35%; p =
      0.004 for Empa). (4) Conclusions. Better results in all variables were observed
      in younger male patients with a shorter duration of diabetes and threshold BMI
      levels of 34.1, treated with SGLT2, and more significantly with Empa.

TI  - Simultaneously Screening for Liver Steatosis and Fibrosis in Romanian Type 2
      Diabetes Mellitus Patients Using Vibration-Controlled Transient Elastography with
      Controlled Attenuation Parameter.
LID - 1753 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/diagnostics12071753 [doi]
AB  - Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common finding among patients with
      type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Between NAFLD and T2DM exist a bidirectional
      relationship. Patients with T2DM are at high risk for NAFLD, and evidence
      suggests that T2DM is linked to progressive NAFLD and poor liver outcomes. NAFLD 
      promotes the development of T2DM and leads to a substantial increase in the risk 
      of T2DM complications. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of liver
      steatosis and fibrosis in patients with T2DM from north-eastern Romania by using 
      Vibration-Controlled Transient Elastography (VCTE) with Controlled Attenuation
      Parameter (CAP), which is a non-invasive method and can assess simultaneously
      liver steatosis and fibrosis. In total, 424 consecutive patients with T2DM were
      enrolled and evaluated using VCTE with CAP from January 2020 to January 2022.
      Clinical and laboratory data were recorded in all patients. For the CAP score, we
      used the following cut-offs: mild steatosis (S1)-274 dB/m, moderate steatosis
      (S2)-290 dB/m, and severe steatosis (S3)-302 dB/m. For liver fibrosis, to
      differentiate between fibrosis stages, the cut-off values were F >/= 8.2 kPa for 
      significant fibrosis (F2), F >/= 9.7 kPa for advanced fibrosis (F3), and F >/=
      13.6 kPa for cirrhosis (F4). In total, 380 diabetic patients (72.6%) had liver
      steatosis (51.3% females, the mean age of 55.22 +/- 10.88 years, mean body mass
      index (BMI) 29.12 +/- 5.64 kg/m(2)). Among them, 26 (8.4%) patients had moderate 
      liver steatosis (S2) and 242 (78.5%) patients had severe hepatic steatosis (S3). 
      According to VCTE measurements, 176 (57.14%) patients had liver fibrosis, 36
      (11.7%) of them had advanced fibrosis (F3), and 42 (13.6%) diabetic patients had 
      cirrhosis (F4). Univariate analyses showed that severe steatosis was
      significantly associated with ferritin (beta = 0.223, p = 0.022), total
      cholesterol (beta = 0.159, p = 0.031), and HDL-cholesterol (beta = -0.120, p =
      0.006). In multivariate analyses, BMI (beta = 0.349, p &lt; 0.001), fasting
      plasma glucose (beta = 0.211, p = 0.006), and triglycerides (beta = 0.132, p =
      0.044) were predictors of S3. Patients with T2DM have a high prevalence of severe
      steatosis and advanced fibrosis which can lead to the development and progression
      of complications with high morbidity and mortality rates. Hence, it is necessary 
      to implement screening strategies to prevent advanced liver disease in patients
      with T2DM.

      Pregnancies, a Pilot Study.
LID - 1732 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/diagnostics12071732 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is associated with aggravated
      oxidation capacity and utero-placental circulation, while aerobic exercise could 
      improve both. The study aims to assess oxidation capacity and utero-placental
      circulation before and after a bout of aerobic exercise in GDM and uncomplicated 
      pregnancies.; Methods: In this cross-sectional study, women with GDM (GDMs) and
      women with uncomplicated pregnancies(controls), underwent 30 min of moderate
      intensity cycling. Total antioxidant capacity (TAC), catalase activity (CAT),
      reduced glutathione (GSH), Uterine Arteries (UtA PI) and Umbilical Artery (UmA
      PI) pulsatility indexes were estimated prior-to, immediately after and one hour
      after exercise; Results: In each group, 25 pregnant women were included. In both 
      groups, between prior-to and immediately after exercise, TAC and CAT increased,
      while GSH decreased, (p &lt; 0.001). In GDMs, CAT was lower than controls at any 
      time point (p &lt; 0.05), while in GDMs delta(Delta) CAT (prior-to and
      immediately after exercise) was lower than controls (p = 0.003). In GDMs, UtA PI 
      centiles decreased between prior-to and either immediately or one hour after
      exercise, while they did not change in controls. In GDMs, pre-conceptional BMI
      and weight gain predicted negatively DeltaTAC (prior-to to one hour after
      exercise); Conclusions: Moderate intensity exercise bout improves oxidation
      capacity in GDM and uncomplicated pregnancies, although at a lesser extent in the
      former. Exercise leads to decreased UtA arteries resistance in women with GDM.

LID - 10.3390/diagnostics12071645 [doi]
AB  - Neonatal platelet hemostasis, although it has been well described over the recent
      years, remains elusive in specific patient populations, including neonates from
      high-risk pregnancies, such as those complicated with gestational diabetes
      mellitus (GDM). We aimed at evaluating the platelet function of neonates born to 
      mothers with GDM using the platelet function analyzer (PFA-100). Cord blood
      samples were drawn from each subject and tested with two different agonists to
      provide two closure time (CT) values (collagen with epinephrine (COL/EPI) and
      collagen with adenosine diphosphate (COL/ADP)). A total of 84 and 118 neonates
      formed the GDM and the control group (neonates from uncomplicated pregnancies),
      respectively. COL/EPI CTs were prolonged in neonates from the GDM group compared 
      to neonates from the control group, while no statistically significant difference
      of COL/ADP CTs was noted between the two groups, GDM and the control. Higher
      COL/ADP CTs were demonstrated in neonates born via cesarean section and in
      neonates with blood group O. A negative correlation between COL/ADP CT and
      gestational age, white blood cells (WBCs) and von Willebrand factor (VWF)
      activity was noted in neonates from the GDM group. In conclusion, neonates from
      the GDM group demonstrate a more hyporesponsive phenotype of their platelets, in 
      comparison to the control neonates.

TI  - Comparison between Machine Learning and Multiple Linear Regression to Identify
      Abnormal Thallium Myocardial Perfusion Scan in Chinese Type 2 Diabetes.
LID - 1619 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/diagnostics12071619 [doi]
AB  - Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients have a high risk of coronary artery
      disease (CAD). Thallium-201 myocardial perfusion scan (Th-201 scan) is a
      non-invasive and extensively used tool in recognizing CAD in clinical settings.
      In this study, we attempted to compare the predictive accuracy of evaluating
      abnormal Th-201 scans using traditional multiple linear regression (MLR) with
      four machine learning (ML) methods. From the study, we can determine whether ML
      surpasses traditional MLR and rank the clinical variables and compare them with
      previous reports.In total, 796 T2DM, including 368 men and 528 women, were
      enrolled. In addition to traditional MLR, classification and regression tree
      (CART), random forest (RF), stochastic gradient boosting (SGB) and eXtreme
      gradient boosting (XGBoost) were also used to analyze abnormal Th-201 scans.
      Stress sum score was used as the endpoint (dependent variable). Our findings show
      that all four root mean square errors of ML are smaller than with MLR, which
      implies that ML is more precise than MLR in determining abnormal Th-201 scans by 
      using clinical parameters. The first seven factors, from the most important to
      the least are:body mass index, hemoglobin, age, glycated hemoglobin, Creatinine, 
      systolic and diastolic blood pressure. In conclusion, ML is not inferior to
      traditional MLR in predicting abnormal Th-201 scans, and the most important
      factors are body mass index, hemoglobin, age, glycated hemoglobin, creatinine,
      systolic and diastolic blood pressure. ML methods are superior in these kinds of 
      studies.

TI  - The Effects of 810 nm Diode Laser and Indocyanine Green on Periodontal Parameters
      and HbA1c in Patients with Periodontitis and Type II Diabetes Mellitus: A
      Randomized Controlled Study.
LID - 1614 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/diagnostics12071614 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of adjunctive periodontal
      therapy of 5 mg/mL indocyanine green irradiation by an 810 nm diode laser (aPDT),
      supplementary to scaling and root planing (SRP) in patients with periodontitis
      and type II diabetes mellitus (DM) compared to the SRP alone, on periodontal
      clinical parameters and glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). The study was conducted 
      on 49 subjects with type II DM and periodontitis, divided into two groups: the
      SRP group (n = 25), who followed SRP alone, and the SRP + aPDT group (n = 24),
      who followed SRP and four weekly sessions of indocyanine green irradiation by an 
      810 nm diode laser. Plaque Index (PI), Bleeding on Probing Index (BOP), probing
      depth (PD), clinical attachment loss (CAL) and HbA1c were investigated at
      baseline and after 6 months. At 6 months, both SRP alone and SRP + aPDT generated
      significant reductions in all the investigated parameters; SRP + aPDT produced
      more significant reductions for BOP, PD and CAL (p &lt; 0.001) but not for PI and
      HbA1c, than SRP alone. aPDT with indocyanine green therapy was well tolerated,
      with two subjects reporting slight discomfort. Therefore, aPDT with indocyanine
      green might represent a good adjunctive periodontal treatment option for SRP in
      patients with type II DM and periodontitis.

TI  - Whole-Body Vibration Associated with Strength Training on the Lower-Limb Blood
      Flow and Mobility in Older Adults with Type 2 Diabetes: A Study Protocol for a
      Randomized Controlled Trial.
LID - 1550 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/diagnostics12071550 [doi]
AB  - Vascular endothelium insults caused by high serum glucose levels affect the
      oxygen supply to tissues, via the microvascular endothelium, resulting in an
      increased perfusion heterogeneity. These insults may lead to the underuse of
      blood capillaries, while other vessels are overused and effectively overload
      their oxygen supply capacity, which eventually causes damages to distal parts of 
      the peripheral nervous system. Therefore, the proprioceptive and exteroceptive
      feedback information will be gradually lost and contribute to a mobility
      reduction. This study aims to assess the efficacy of whole-body vibration (WBV)
      associated with strength training (ST) on lower-limb blood flow and mobility in
      older adults with type 2 diabetes (DM2). METHODS AND ANALYSES: This is a protocol
      (1st version) for Pa single-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trial guided
      by the SPIRIT guidelines. Our sample will consist of 51 older adults with DM2
      randomly allocated to three groups: low frequency WBV (16-26 Hz) associated to ST
      (G1), WBV sham (G2) and nonintervention control (G3). The study protocol is set
      for a 12-week (three times per week) schedule. PRIMARY OUTCOMES: skin temperature
      using infrared thermographic imaging (ITI); mean peripheral arterial blood flow
      velocity (MBF) by a handheld Doppler ultrasound (DU), and functional mobility by 
      Timed Up and Go (TUG) test. SECONDARY OUTCOMES: quasi-static posture using the
      DX100 BTS Smart optoelectronic system, and plantar pressure and body balance
      using the MPS stabilometric platform. Data will be collected and analyzed at
      baseline and post-intervention, considering p-value &lt; 0.05 level of
      significance. The analyses will also be conducted with an intention-to-treat
      method and effect size. DISSEMINATION: All results will be published in
      peer-reviewed journals as well as presented in conferences.

TI  - Hibiscus sabdariffa in Diabetes Prevention and Treatment-Does It Work? An
      Evidence-Based Review.
LID - 2134 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/foods11142134 [doi]
AB  - Diabetes is currently a global health problem that is already reported as an
      epidemic. This metabolic disease, characterized by a disturbance in the
      carbohydrate, protein, and lipid metabolism, is often accompanied by disorders of
      several organs. Its treatment is expensive and often difficult to control.
      Therefore, it seems necessary to search for new drugs and solutions to facilitate
      therapy and reduce treatment costs. Herbal medicines are becoming more and more
      popular. Hibiscus sabdariffa (roselle) is a plant that grows wild in a tropical
      climate. It has been used in folk medicine for thousands of years. Thanks to the 
      numerous active compounds, including polyphenols, polysaccharides, organic acids,
      or pectins, it is reported to exhibit hypoglycemic, antioxidant, hypotensive, and
      anti-lipidemic activities and numerous indirect effects that are related to them.
      The aim of this review was to update the knowledge about the therapeutic effects 
      of roselle in diabetes and its comorbidities based on in vitro, animal, and human
      studies. After a careful analysis of the scientific literature, it can be stated 
      that roselle is a promising product that can be used either on its own or as an
      addition to the conventional treatment regimens to prevent or treat diabetes and 
      its accompanying diseases.

TI  - Hyperuricemia, a Non-Independent Component of Metabolic Syndrome, Only Predicts
      Renal Outcome in Chronic Kidney Disease Patients without Metabolic Syndrome or
      Diabetes.
LID - 1719 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/biomedicines10071719 [doi]
AB  - Uric acid (UA) is elevated in metabolic syndrome (MS) and diabetes (DM). UA is
      associated with central obesity and blood glucose and is proposed as a criterion 
      of MS. Previous reports showed that UA could predict renal outcome in CKD.
      However, recent clinical trials did not demonstrate the benefits of
      urate-lowering agents (ULA) for renal outcome. Whether the prognostic value of UA
      for renal outcome is independent of MS or secondary to MS in CKD patients is
      unknown. Our study included 2500 CKD stage 1-4 Asian patients divided by UA
      tertiles and MS/DM. In linear regression, UA was associated with obesity,
      C-reactive protein, and renal function. In Cox regression, high UA was associated
      with worse renal outcome in non-MS/DM, but not in MS/DM: hazard ratio (95%
      confidence interval) of UA tertile 3 was 3.86 (1.87-7.97) in non-MS/DM and 1.00
      (0.77-1.30) in MS/DM (p for interaction &lt; 0.05). MS was associated with worse 
      renal outcome, but redefined MS (including hyperuricemia as the 6th criteria) was
      not. In conclusion, hyperuricemia is associated with worse renal outcome in
      non-MS/DM and is not an independent component of MS in CKD stage 1-4 patients.
      Hyperuricemia secondary to MS could not predict renal outcome.

TI  - Comparing the Effects of Canagliflozin vs. Glimepiride by Body Mass Index in
      Patients with Type 2 Diabetes and Chronic Heart Failure: A Subanalysis of the
      CANDLE Trial.
LID - 1656 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/biomedicines10071656 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We present results of a 24-week comparative study of the effects of
      the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor canagliflozin vs. the
      sulfonylurea glimepiride, by baseline body mass index (BMI), in patients with
      type 2 diabetes and chronic heart failure. METHODS: We conducted a post hoc
      analysis of the CANDLE trial. This subanalysis evaluated NT-proBNP, BMI, and
      other laboratory parameters, according to the subgroups stratified by BMI >/= 25 
      kg/m(2) vs. BMI &lt; 25 kg/m(2). RESULTS: A group ratio of proportional changes
      in the geometric means of NT-proBNP was 0.99 (p = 0.940) for the subgroup with
      BMI >/= 25 kg/m(2) and 0.85 (p = 0.075) for the subgroup with BMI &lt; 25
      kg/m(2), respectively. When baseline BMI was modeled as a continuous variable,
      results for patients with BMI &lt; 30 kg/m(2) showed a slightly smaller increase 
      in NT-proBNP in the canagliflozin group vs. the glimepiride group (p = 0.295);
      that difference was not seen among patients with BMI >/=30 kg/m(2) (p = 0.948).
      Irrespective of obesity, the canagliflozin group was associated with significant 
      reduction in BMI compared to the glimepiride group. CONCLUSION: There was no
      significant difference in the effects of canagliflozin, relative to glimepiride, 
      on NT-proBNP concentrations irrespective of baseline obesity. UMIN clinical trial
      registration number: UMIN000017669.

TI  - The Potential Role of Myokines/Hepatokines in the Progression of Neuronal Damage 
      in Streptozotocin and High-Fat Diet-Induced Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Mice.
LID - 1521 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/biomedicines10071521 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetes is highly prevalent, and the number of patients with
      diabetic sarcopenia and cognitive impairment has grown, leading to decreased
      quality of life. Although the exact mechanisms between sarcopenia and cognitive
      impairment have not been elucidated, it is speculated that muscle and
      liver-derived mediators might contribute to brain function. This study examined
      the molecular mechanisms associated with muscle-brain interaction accompanied by 
      insulin resistance (IR) caused by aberrant energy metabolism via
      myokines/hepatokines in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) mice. METHODS: T2DM was
      induced by a high-fat diet and streptozotocin injection. Behavior tests were
      conducted to analyze grip strength and cognitive function. Histopathological
      changes in skeletal muscle and brain tissue were examined by hematoxylin and
      eosin staining and the protein levels of biomarkers related to energy metabolism 
      via myokines/hepatokines were measured by western blot. RESULTS: T2DM caused
      peripheral and central IR. Furthermore, T2DM led to aberrant energy metabolism
      through the reduced fibroblast growth factor 21 dependent AMP-activated kinase
      (AMPK)/surtuin1/proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1alpha pathway 
      in T2DM. Subsequently, reduced circulating myokines/hepatokines were in
      accordance with their levels with hippocampal neuronal markers in T2DM mice.
      Accordingly, skeletal muscle (muscle strength: 2.83 +/- 0.39 vs. 2.187 +/- 0.51, 
      p = 0.004) and brain function (PAT: 38.5 +/- 57.91 vs. 11.556 +/- 12.03, p =
      0.02) impairment and morphological changes (muscle cross-sectional area: 872.43
      +/- 242.87 vs. 743.68 +/- 169.31, p = 0.01; density of neurons in hippocampus:
      145 +/- 15.13 vs. 77 +/- 35.51, p = 0.05; density of neurons in cortex: 138.333
      +/- 6.66 vs. 78 +/- 17.35, p = 0.05) were shown in T2DM mice. In addition, the
      working ability demonstrated by Y-maze was positively correlated with % lean mass
      (p = 0.046, R = 0.3426). CONCLUSIONS: T2DM led to aberrant energy in skeletal
      muscle and brain via myokines/hepatokines. This study suggested that myokines and
      hepatokines might have potential roles in skeletal muscle and central metabolic
      functions which can mediate cognitive function in T2DM mice.

      Disease and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.
LID - 1487 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/biomedicines10071487 [doi]
AB  - Liver fibrosis is a key pathophysiology process in chronic liver disease. It is
      still unclear whether the impact of liver fibrosis is not fully realized in type 
      2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD),
      and the factors affecting nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) or liver stiffness 
      also remain unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the determinants of
      liver fibrosis and in T2D patients with NAFLD. Liver fibrosis and steatosis were 
      measured using transient elastography (FibroScan). Of 226 T2D patients with
      NAFLD, 50 with liver fibrosis had higher body mass index, serum uric acid,
      triglyceride and glycated hemoglobin levels and lower high density lipoprotein
      levels than 176 without liver fibrosis. Multivariate analysis revealed that
      aging, obesity, sulfonylurea usage and high levels of AST increased the risk of
      liver fibrosis in T2D patients with NAFLD. Our findings provide useful
      information to clinical physicians for earlier detection of liver fibrosis in T2D
      patients with NAFLD and to prevent liver fibrosis through controlling these risk 
      factors.

TI  - Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus with Tight Glucose Control and Poor Pre-Injury Stair
      Climbing Capacity May Predict Postoperative Delirium: A Secondary Analysis.
LID - 951 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/brainsci12070951 [doi]
AB  - (1) Background: Previous evidence demonstrates that tight glycemic control and
      good physical function could reduce the risk of delirium. This study aimed to
      investigate whether the occurrence of postoperative delirium (POD) in older hip
      fracture surgery patients is associated with preoperative glycemic control
      factors or pre-injury physical performance. (2) Methods: Three-hundred and nine
      individuals aged over 65 years and scheduled for hip fracture surgery were
      included at a single center. Glycemic control factors and pre-injury physical
      performance were assessed preoperatively. The presence of delirium was assessed
      using the Confusion Assessment Method on postoperative hospitalization days.
      Univariate and multivariable logistic regression models and a risk prediction
      model of POD were established. (3) Results: Among the 309 patients, 52 (16.83%)
      experienced POD during the hospital stay. The numbers of pre-injury physical
      performance and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients were significantly
      different in the POD and non-POD groups. The multivariable model showed that
      development of delirium was significantly explained by preoperative fasting blood
      glucose (FBG) (OR 0.804, p = 0.004), stair climbing (OR 0.709, p = 0.003), T2DM
      (odds ratio (OR) 3.654, p = 0.001), and age-adjusted Charlson comorbidity index
      (ACCI) (OR 1.270, p = 0.038). The area under the receiver operating
      characteristic curve (AUROC) of the risk prediction model including those
      covariates was 0.770. (4) Conclusions: More older T2DM patients develop POD after
      hip fracture surgery than patients without T2DM. A simple assessment of
      preoperative FBG and pre-injury stair climbing capacity may identify those at
      high risk for the development of POD. Higher preoperative FBG and good pre-injury
      stair climbing capacity are protective factors for POD.

TI  - LncRNA-Associated Genetic Etiologies Are Shared between Type 2 Diabetes and
      Cancers in the UAE Population.
LID - 3313 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/cancers14143313 [doi]
AB  - Numerous epidemiological studies place patients with T2D at a higher risk for
      cancer. Many risk factors, such as obesity, ageing, poor diet and low physical
      activity, are shared between T2D and cancer; however, the biological mechanisms
      linking the two diseases remain largely unknown. The advent of genome wide
      association studies (GWAS) revealed large numbers of genetic variants associated 
      with both T2D and cancer. Most significant disease-associated variants reside in 
      non-coding regions of the genome. Several studies show that single nucleotide
      polymorphisms (SNPs) at or near long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) genes may impact the
      susceptibility to T2D and cancer. Therefore, the identification of genetic
      variants predisposing individuals to both T2D and cancer may help explain the
      increased risk of cancer in T2D patients. We aim to investigate whether lncRNA
      genetic variants with significant diabetes and cancer associations overlap in the
      UAE population. We first performed an annotation-based analysis of UAE T2D GWAS, 
      confirming the high prevalence of variants at or near non-coding RNA genes. We
      then explored whether these T2D SNPs in lncRNAs were relevant to cancer. We
      highlighted six non-coding genetic variants, jointly reaching statistical
      significance in T2D and cancer, implicating a shared genetic architecture between
      the two diseases in the UAE population.

TI  - The Impact of Insulin-Induced Lipodystrophy on Glycemic Variability in Pediatric 
      Patients with Type 1 Diabetes.
LID - 1087 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/children9071087 [doi]
AB  - Lipodystrophy is the most common dermatological complication in patients with
      diabetes on insulin therapy. Despite the high frequency of lipodystrophy, there
      are still several difficulties in giving advice about avoidance into practice
      among children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes and their caregivers. This
      cross-sectional study aims to evaluate the prevalence of insulin-induced
      lipodystrophy in a cohort of pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes, to identify
      associated clinical factors and to assess its influence on glycemic control. Two 
      hundred and twelve patients attending our Diabetes Center during a three-month
      period were enrolled. The presence of lipodystrophy was assessed by inspection
      and palpation procedures. Demographic and clinical data including type of
      treatment, frequency of rotation of insulin administration sites, and glucose
      metrics of the previous 30 days were assessed and statistically analyzed.
      Prevalence of lipohypertrophy was 44.3%. Two patients were affected by
      lipoatrophy (0.9%). Improper rotation of insulin administration sites and low
      awareness on lipodystrophy were associated to the occurrence of this skin
      condition (p = 0.050 and p = 0.005, respectively). When comparing patients with
      and without lipodystrophy, a significant difference in glycemic variability
      parameters was detected (p = 0.036 for coefficient of variation, p = 0.029 for
      standard deviation score of glucose levels). Lipodystrophy still represents a
      common complication in patients on insulin therapy. The present study reveals its
      negative impact on glycemic variability. This finding emphasizes the importance
      of prevention strategies to minimize the occurrence of this dermatological
      complication that may interfere with clinical history of the disease.

TI  - Maternal Pre-Pregnancy Obesity and Gestational Diabetes Mellitus Increase the
      Risk of Childhood Obesity.
LID - 928 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/children9070928 [doi]
AB  - Previous studies have shown inconsistent results regarding the effects of
      maternal gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and pre-pregnancy obesity (PPO) on
      childhood obesity. This study aimed to determine the risk for early childhood
      obesity based on maternal GDM and PPO. This nationwide study used data obtained
      from the National Health Information Database in South Korea. The participants
      were divided into four groups based on maternal GDM and PPO, and 1:1 matching was
      performed. Each group had 1319 participants. A generalized estimating equation
      model was used to analyze the changes in body mass index percentile of children
      with age, and simple and multiple conditional logistic regression models were
      used to compare the prevalence of childhood obesity at 5 years. Children whose
      mothers had both PPO and GDM, only PPO, or only GDM had a 4.46 (95% CI:
      3.28-6.05, p &lt; 0.001), 3.11 (95% CI: 2.27-4.26, p &lt; 0.001), or 1.58 (95%
      CI: 1.12-2.23, p = 0.010) times higher risk, respectively, of developing
      childhood obesity than children whose mothers had neither PPO nor GDM. Maternal
      PPO increases the risk for childhood obesity to a higher degree than maternal
      GDM, and the presence of both increases the risk even further.

TI  - Oxidative Stress in Type 2 Diabetes: The Case for Future Pediatric Redoxomics
      Studies.
LID - 1336 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/antiox11071336 [doi]
AB  - Considerable evidence supports the role of oxidative stress in adult type 2
      diabetes (T2D). Due to increasing rates of pediatric obesity, lack of physical
      activity, and consumption of excess food calories, it is projected that the
      number of children living with insulin resistance, prediabetes, and T2D will
      markedly increase with enormous worldwide economic costs. Understanding the
      factors contributing to oxidative stress and T2D risk may help develop optimal
      early intervention strategies. Evidence suggests that oxidative stress, triggered
      by excess dietary fat consumption, causes excess mitochondrial hydrogen peroxide 
      emission in skeletal muscle, alters redox status, and promotes insulin resistance
      leading to T2D. The pathophysiological events arising from excess calorie-induced
      mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production are complex and not yet
      investigated in children. Systems medicine is an integrative approach leveraging 
      conventional medical information and environmental factors with data obtained
      from "omics" technologies such as genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics. In
      adults with T2D, systems medicine shows promise in risk assessment and predicting
      drug response. Redoxomics is a branch of systems medicine focusing on "omics"
      data related to redox status. Systems medicine with a complementary emphasis on
      redoxomics can potentially optimize future healthcare strategies for adults and
      children with T2D.

TI  - Pancreatic Transdifferentiation Using beta-Cell Transcription Factors for Type 1 
      Diabetes Treatment.
LID - 2145 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/cells11142145 [doi]
AB  - Type 1 diabetes is a chronic illness in which the native beta (beta)-cell
      population responsible for insulin release has been the subject of autoimmune
      destruction. This condition requires patients to frequently measure their blood
      glucose concentration and administer multiple daily exogenous insulin injections 
      accordingly. Current treatments fail to effectively treat the disease without
      significant side effects, and this has led to the exploration of different
      approaches for its treatment. Gene therapy and the use of viral vectors has been 
      explored extensively and has been successful in treating a range of diseases. The
      use of viral vectors to deliver beta-cell transcription factors has been
      researched in the context of type 1 diabetes to induce the pancreatic
      transdifferentiation of cells to replace the beta-cell population destroyed in
      patients. Studies have used various combinations of pancreatic and beta-cell
      transcription factors in order to induce pancreatic transdifferentiation and have
      achieved varying levels of success. This review will outline why pancreatic
      transcription factors have been utilised and how their application can allow the 
      development of insulin-producing cells from non beta-cells and potentially act as
      a cure for type 1 diabetes.

      Diabetes.
LID - 982 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/biom12070982 [doi]
AB  - For the past several decades, the prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D)
      has continued to rise on a global level. The risk contributing to this pandemic
      implicates both genetic and environmental factors, which are functionally
      integrated by epigenetic mechanisms. While these conditions are accompanied by
      major abnormalities in fuel metabolism, evidence indicates that altered immune
      cell functions also play an important role in shaping of obesity and T2D
      phenotypes. Interestingly, these events have been shown to be determined by
      epigenetic mechanisms. Consistently, recent epigenome-wide association studies
      have demonstrated that immune cells from obese and T2D individuals feature
      specific epigenetic profiles when compared to those from healthy subjects. In
      this work, we have reviewed recent literature reporting epigenetic changes
      affecting the immune cell phenotype and function in obesity and T2D. We will
      further discuss therapeutic strategies targeting epigenetic marks for treating

TI  - Untargeted Metabolomic Plasma Profiling of Emirati Dialysis Patients with
      Diabetes versus Non-Diabetic: A Pilot Study.
LID - 962 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/biom12070962 [doi]
AB  - Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is a severe irreversible complication of diabetes
      mellitus that further disturbs glucose metabolism. Identifying metabolic changes 
      in the blood may provide early insight into DKD pathogenesis. This study aims to 
      determine blood biomarkers differentiating DKD from non-diabetic kidney disease
      in the Emirati population utilizing the LC-MS/MS platform. Blood samples were
      collected from hemodialysis subjects with and without diabetes to detect
      indicators of pathological changes using an untargeted metabolomics approach.
      Metabolic profiles were analyzed based on clinically confirmed diabetic status
      and current HbA1c values. Five differentially significant metabolites were
      identified based on the clinically confirmed diabetic status, including
      hydroxyprogesterone and 3,4-Dihydroxymandelic acid. Similarly, we identified
      seven metabolites with apparent differences between Dialysis Diabetic (DD) and
      Dialysis non-Diabetic (DND) groups, including isovalerylglycine based on HbA1c
      values. Likewise, the top three metabolic pathways, including Tyrosine
      metabolism, were identified following the clinically confirmed diabetic status.
      As a result, nine different metabolites were enriched in the identified metabolic
      pathways, such as 3,4-Dihydroxymandelic acid. As a result, eleven different
      metabolites were enriched, including Glycerol. This study provides an insight
      into blood metabolic changes related to DKD that may lead to more effective
      management strategies.

TI  - Association between Higher Circulating Leucine-Rich alpha-2 Glycoprotein 1
      Concentrations and Specific Plasma Ceramides in Postmenopausal Women with Type 2 
      Diabetes.
LID - 943 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/biom12070943 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although ceramides are involved in the pathophysiology of
      cardiovascular disease and other inflammation-associated disorders, there is a
      paucity of data on the association between plasma ceramides and inflammatory
      biomarkers in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Therefore, we explored whether
      there was an association between plasma leucine-rich alpha-2 glycoprotein 1
      (LRG1) concentrations (i.e., a novel proinflammatory signaling molecule) and
      specific plasma ceramides in postmenopausal women with T2DM. METHODS: We measured
      six previously identified plasma ceramides, which have been associated with
      increased cardiovascular risk [plasma Cer(d18:1/16:0), Cer(d18:1/18:0),
      Cer(d18:1/20:0), Cer(d18:1/22:0), Cer(d18:1/24:0) and Cer(d18:1/24:1)], amongst
      99 Caucasian postmenopausal women with non-insulin-treated T2DM (mean age 72 +/- 
      8 years, mean hemoglobin A1c 6.9 +/- 0.7%), who consecutively attended our
      diabetes outpatient service during a 3-month period. Plasma ceramide and LRG1
      concentrations were measured with a targeted liquid chromatography-tandem mass
      spectrometry assay and a Milliplex((R)) MAP human cardiovascular disease magnetic
      bead kit, respectively. RESULTS: In linear regression analyses, higher plasma
      LRG1 levels (1st tertile vs. 2nd and 3rd tertiles combined) were associated with 
      higher levels of plasma Cer(d18:1/16:0) (standardized beta coefficient: 0.289, p 
      = 0.004), Cer(d18:1/18:0) (standardized beta coefficient: 0.307, p = 0.002),
      Cer(d18:1/20:0) (standardized beta coefficient: 0.261, p = 0.009) or
      Cer(d18:1/24:1) (standardized beta coefficient: 0.343, p &lt; 0.001). These
      associations remained significant even after adjusting for age, body mass index, 
      systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol level, hemoglobin A1c, insulin
      resistance and statin use. CONCLUSIONS: The results of our pilot exploratory
      study suggest that higher plasma LRG1 concentration was associated with higher
      levels of specific high-risk plasma ceramide molecules in elderly postmenopausal 
      women with metabolically well-controlled T2DM, even after adjusting for known
      cardiovascular risk factors and other potential confounding variables.

TI  - Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events and Mortality Prediction by Circulating
      GDF-15 in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
LID - 934 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/biom12070934 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15) is a homeostatic cytokine
      that regulates neural and cardio-metabolic functions, and its release is
      increased in response to stress, injury, and inflammation. In patients with
      coronary artery disease and heart failure (HF), three separate meta-analyses have
      found that elevated circulating GDF-15 was predictive of major adverse
      cardiovascular events (MACE), but none has evaluated its effects on incident MACE
      including HF and mortality hazard in type 2 diabetes. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE,
      and Scopus databases were queried. Articles that met the predefined eligibility
      criteria, including prospective studies that reported adjusted hazard ratios
      (aHRs), were selected according to the Cochrane Handbook and PRISMA guidelines.
      Study endpoints were (1) MACE including HF, and (2) all-cause mortality.
      Different GDF-15 concentration measurements were harmonized using a validated
      mathematical approach to express log2-transformed values in per standard
      deviation (SD). Study heterogeneity (I(2)), quality, and bias were assessed.
      RESULTS: 19354 patients in 8 prospective studies were included. In 7 studies that
      reported 4247 MACE among 19200 participants, the incident rate was 22.1% during a
      median follow-up of 5.6 years. It was found that four of eight studies included
      HF decompensation or hospitalization as a component of MACE. In 5 studies that
      reported all-cause mortality, 1893 of 13223 patients died, at an incidence rate
      of 15.1% over 5.0 years. Of note, each 1 SD increase of log2[GDF-15] was
      associated with aHRs of 1.12 (1.09-1.15, I(2) = 5%, p &lt; 0.000001) and 1.27
      (1.11-1.46, I(2) = 86%, p = 0.00062) and for MACE and all-cause mortality,
      respectively. CONCLUSION: Elevated circulating level of GDF-15 was robustly
      predictive of MACE in patients with T2D but its prognostic significance in the
      prediction of mortality requires further studies.

TI  - Unique Metabolic Profiles Associate with Gestational Diabetes and Ethnicity in
      Low and High-Risk Women Living in the UK.
LID - nxac163 [pii]

AB  - BACKGROUND: Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) is the most common global
      pregnancy complication; however, prevalence varies substantially between
      ethnicities with South Asians (SA) experiencing up to 3-times the risk of the
      disease compared to white Europeans (WEs). Factors driving this discrepancy are
      unclear, although the metabolome is of great interest as GDM is known to be
      characterised by metabolic dysregulation. OBJECTIVES: This primary aim was to
      characterise and compare the metabolic profiles of GDM in SA and WE women (at <
      28 weeks' gestation) from the Born in Bradford (BIB) prospective birth cohort in 
      the UK. METHODS: 146 fasting serum metabolites, from 2668 pregnant WE and 2671
      pregnant South Asian (SA) women (average BMI 26.2 kg/m2, average age 27.3 years) 
      were analysed using partial least squares discriminatory analyses to characterise
      GDM status. Linear associations between metabolite values and post-oral glucose
      tolerance test measures of dysglycemia (fasting glucose and 2-hour post glucose) 
      were also examined. RESULTS: Seven metabolites associated with GDM status in both
      ethnicities (variable importance in projection (VIP) >/=1), while 6 additional
      metabolites associated with GDM only in WE women. Unique metabolic profiles were 
      observed in healthy weight women who later developed GDM, with distinct
      metabolite patterns identified by ethnicity and BMI status. Of the metabolite
      values analysed in relation to dysglycemia, lactate, histidine, apolipoprotein
      A1, HDL cholesterol, HDL2 cholesterol associated with decreased glucose
      concentration, while DHA and the diameter of very low-density lipoprotein
      particles (nm) associated with increased glucose concertation in WE women; while 
      in SAs albumin alone associated with decreased glucose concentration.
      CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that the metabolic risk profile for GDM differs
      between WE and SA women enrolled in BiB the UK. This suggests that aetiology of
      the disease differs between ethnic groups and that ethnic-appropriate prevention 
      strategies may be beneficial.

TI  - Adipose-derived stromal cells reverse insulin resistance through inhibition of M1
      expression in a type 2 diabetes mellitus mouse model.
PG  - 357
LID - 10.1186/s13287-022-03046-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Adipose tissue inflammation is considered as one of the major
      mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of insulin resistance and complications in
      diabetes. Here, we aimed to study the effects of adipose-derived stromal cells on
      diabetes-induced insulin resistance and M1 cytokine expression. METHODS: Stromal 
      vascular fractions (SVFs) purified from the inguinal adipose tissue of diabetic
      mice were treated with plasma from either nondiabetic (Lepr(+/+)) or diabetic
      (Lepr(db/db)) mice and injected into the inguinal white adipose tissue of
      Lepr(db/db) mice. RESULTS: We found that diabetic plasma treatment induced,
      whereas nondiabetic plasma suppressed TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and dipeptidyl
      peptidase 4 (DPP4) mRNA expression in SVFs in vitro. Importantly, the injection
      of nondiabetic plasma-treated SVFs significantly decreased TNF-alpha, IL-6,
      IL-1beta, CCL2, and IL-33 and induced IL-10 mRNA expression in adipose tissue of 
      Lepr(db/db) mice in vivo. Furthermore, we observed that nondiabetic
      plasma-treated SVFs increased mRNA expression of Foxp3 in adipose tissue
      macrophages and Foxp3 in adipose CD4(+) T cells, decreased CD11b(+)CD11c(+) cells
      in adipose tissue, and suppressed mRNA expression of ICAM-1, FCM3, IL-6,
      IL-1beta, iNOS, TNF-alpha, and DPP4 as well as protein expression of DPP4 and
      phosphorylated JNK and NF-kappaB in the liver of Lepr(db/db) mice. Moreover, we
      found that nondiabetic plasma-treated SVFs increased Akt activation following
      insulin administration and attenuated glucose intolerance in Lepr(db/db) mice.
      CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that nondiabetic plasma inhibits M1 but
      increases M2 cytokine expression in adipose tissue of diabetic mice. Most
      importantly, our findings reveal that nondiabetic plasma-treated SVFs are capable
      of mitigating diabetes-induced plasma DPP4 activity, liver inflammation, and
      insulin resistance and that may be mediated through suppressing M1 cytokines but 
      increasing IL-10 and Tregs in adipose tissue. Altogether, our findings suggest
      that adipose stromal cell-based therapy could potentially be developed as an
      efficient therapeutic strategy for the treatment of diabetes.

TI  - Bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells for diabetes therapy: touch, fuse, and fix?
PG  - 348
LID - 10.1186/s13287-022-03028-2 [doi]
AB  - Bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (BM-MSCs) have anti-inflammatory and
      pro-survival properties. Naturally, they do not express human leukocyte antigen
      class II surface antigens and have immunosuppressive capabilities. Together with 
      their relatively easy accessibility and expansion, they are an attractive tool
      for organ support in transplantation and regenerative therapy. Autologous BM-MSC 
      transplantation alone or together with transplanted islets improves beta-cell
      function, graft survival, and glycemic control in diabetes. Albeit MSCs' capacity
      to transdifferentiate into beta-cell is limited, their protective effects are
      mediated mainly by paracrine mechanisms through BM-MSCs circulating through the
      body. Direct cell-cell contact and spontaneous fusion of BM-MSCs with injured
      cells, although at a very low rate, are further mechanisms of their supportive
      effect and for tissue regeneration. Diabetes is a disease of long-term chronic
      inflammation and cell therapy requires stable, highly functional cells. Several
      tools and protocols have been developed by mimicking natural fusion events to
      induce and accelerate fusion in vitro to promote beta-cell-specific gene
      expression in fused cells. BM-MSC-islet fusion before transplantation may be a
      strategy for long-term islet survival and improved function. This review
      discusses the cell-protective and anti-inflammatory characteristics of BM-MSCs to
      boost highly functional insulin-producing cells in vitro and in vivo, and the
      efficacy of their fusion with beta-cells as a path to promote beta-cell
      regeneration.

PG  - e052554
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2021-052554 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is often associated with
      adverse pregnancy outcomes. However, the association of risk factors with GDM
      diagnosis, maternal and neonatal health outcomes is less established when
      compared with women without GDM. We aim to examine the diagnostic accuracy of the
      conventional and novel risk factors for a GDM diagnosis and their impact on
      maternal and neonatal health outcomes. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This retrospective
      cohort and nested case-control study at six public health clinics is based on
      medical records and questionnaire survey of women between 2 and 12 months
      postpartum. The estimated required sample size is 876 complete records (292
      cases, 584 control, at a ratio of 1:2). Oral glucose tolerance test results will 
      be used to identify glucose dysregulation, and maternal and neonatal outcomes
      include maternal weight gain, pre-eclampsia, polyhydramnios, mode of delivery,
      preterm or postdate birth, complications in labour, birth weight, gestational age
      at birth, Apgar score, congenital anomaly, congenital hypothyroidism, neonatal
      death or stillbirth, hypoglycaemia and hyperbilirubinaemia. Psychosocial measures
      include the WHO Quality of Life: brief, mother-infant bonding (14-item Postpartum
      Bonding Questionnaire and 19-item Maternal Postnatal Attachment Scale), anxiety
      (7-item Generalised Anxiety Disorder), depression (9-item Patient Health
      Questionnaire) and stress (Perceived Stress Scale symptoms) questionnaires. The
      comparative incidences of maternal and neonatal health outcomes, the comparative 
      prevalence of the psychosocial outcomes between women with GDM and without GDM,
      specificity, sensitivity, positive and negative predictive values of the risk
      factors, separately and combined, will be reported. All GDM risk factors and
      outcomes will be modelled using multivariable regression analysis and the
      receiver operating characteristics curve will be reported. ETHICS AND
      DISSEMINATION: This study was approved by the Malaysia Research and Ethics
      Committee, Ministry of Health Malaysia. Informed consent will be obtained from
      all participants. Findings will be submitted for publications in scientific
      journals.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Hyperglycaemia during pregnancy is associated with cardiometabolic
      risks for the mother and the offspring. Mothers with gestational diabetes
      mellitus (GDM) have signs of subclinical atherosclerosis, including increased
      carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT). We assessed whether GDM is associated with
      increased CIMT in the offspring at birth. DESIGN AND SETTING: MySweetHeart Cohort
      is a prospective cohort study conducted in Switzerland. PARTICIPANTS, EXPOSURE
      AND OUTCOME MEASURES: This work included pregnant women with and without GDM at
      24-32 weeks of gestation and their singleton live-born offspring with data on the
      primary outcome of CIMT. GDM was diagnosed based on the criteria of the
      International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups. Offspring's
      CIMT was measured by ultrasonography after birth (range 1-19 days). RESULTS: Data
      on CIMT were available for 99 offspring of women without GDM and 101 offspring of
      women with GDM. Maternal age ranged from 18 to 47 years. Some 16% of women with
      GDM and 6% of women without GDM were obese. Smoking during pregnancy was more
      frequent among women with GDM (18%) than among those without GDM (4%). Neonatal
      characteristics were comparable between the two groups. The difference in CIMT
      between offspring of women with and without GDM was of 0.00 mm (95% CI -0.01 to
      0.01; p=0.96) and remained similar on adjustment for potential confounding
      factors, such as maternal prepregnancy body mass index, maternal education,
      smoking during pregnancy, family history of diabetes, as well as offspring's sex,
      age, and body surface area (0.00 mm (95% CI -0.02 to 0.01; p=0.45)). CONCLUSIONS:
      We found no evidence of increased CIMT in neonates exposed to GDM. A longer-term 
      follow-up that includes additional vascular measures, such as endothelial
      function or arterial stiffness, may shed further light on the cardiovascular
      health trajectories in children born to mothers with GDM. TRIAL REGISTRATION

TI  - Screening for Gestational Diabetes Mellitus and Pregnancy Outcomes: Results from 
      a Multicentric Study in Tajikistan.

AB  - The prevalence of gestational diabetes parallels the prevalence of type 2
      diabetes mellitus and is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. However,
      these data are not available for many parts of the world. We assessed the
      prevalence of gestational diabetes and pregnancy outcomes in Tajikistan. This
      cohort study included 2438 consecutively recruited representative pregnant women 
      from 8 locations in two cities in Tajikistan, in whom an oral glucose tolerance
      test (75 g, fasting, 1 h, 2 h) was performed during gestational weeks 24-28.
      Women with known diabetes and twin pregnancies were excluded. Associations
      between glucose tolerance test results and pregnancy outcomes were examined.
      According to the WHO 2013 thresholds, 32.4% of women qualified as having
      gestational diabetes, the vast majority (29.7%) based on an elevated fasting
      glucose level (5.1-5.6 mmol/L), while only 2.8% had elevated 1- or 2-hour values 
      or met more than one threshold. Women with only elevated fasting glucose
      (impaired gestational fasting glycemia) had no evidence of adverse pregnancy
      outcomes, while those with elevated 1- and/or 2-hour values (impaired gestational
      glucose tolerance) had more pregnancy complications (infection of urinary tract
      1.8 vs. 8.8% p<0.001; preeclampsia 0.7 vs. 10.3% p<0.001) and emergency cesarean 
      sections (4.4 vs. 13.2% p=0.002). Neonates from pregnancies with impaired
      gestational glucose tolerance had lower APGARs, lower birth weights, lower 30 min
      glucose levels, and a lower probability of being discharged alive (all p<0.05).
      In conclusion, the formal prevalence of gestational diabetes is high in
      Tajikistan; however, this does not translate into adverse pregnancy outcomes for 
      women with impaired gestational fasting glycemia.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mobile health (mHealth) platforms can affect health behaviors but
      have not been rigorously tested in randomized trials. OBJECTIVES: We sought to
      evaluate the effectiveness of a pragmatic mHealth intervention in patients with
      HF and DM Methods: We conducted a multicenter randomized trial in 187 patients
      with both HF and DM to assessing a mHealth intervention to improve physical
      activity and medication adherence compared to usual care. The primary endpoint
      was change in mean daily step count from baseline through 3 months. Other
      outcomes included medication adherence, health related quality of life, and
      metabolomic profiling. RESULTS: The mHealth group had an increase in daily step
      count of 151 steps/day at 3 months whereas the usual care group had a decline of 
      162 steps/day (LS-mean between-group difference=313 steps/day; 95% CI: 8, 619,
      p=0.044). Medication adherence measured using the Voils Adherence Questionnaire
      did not change from baseline to 3 months (LS-mean change -0.08 in mHealth vs.
      -0.15 in usual care, p=0.47). The mHealth group had an improvement in Kansas City
      Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire Overall Summary Score (KCCQ-OSS) compared to the
      usual care group (LS-mean difference=5.5 points, 95% CI: 1.4, 9.6, p=0.009).
      Thirteen metabolites, primarily medium- and long-chain acylcarnitines, changed
      differently between treatment groups from baseline to 3 months (p < 0.05).
      CONCLUSIONS: In patients with HF and DM, a 3-month mHealth intervention
      significantly improved daily physical activity, health related quality of life
      and metabolomic markers of cardiovascular health, but not medication adherence.
      CLINICALTRIALS: gov Identifier: NCT02918175 Condensed Abstract: Heart failure
      (HF) and diabetes (DM) have overlapping biologic and behavioral risk factors. We 
      conducted a multicenter randomized, clinical trial in 187 patients with both HF
      (regardless of ejection fraction) and DM to assess whether a mHealth intervention
      could improve physical activity and medication adherence. The mHealth group had
      an increase in mean daily step count and quality of life but not medication
      adherence. Medium- and long-chain acylcarnitines changed differently between
      treatment groups from baseline to 3 months (p < 0.05). These data have important 
      implications for designing effective lifestyle interventions in HF and DM.

      for American Indian and Alaska Native Men During the COVID-19 Pandemic.
PG  - 85-103
LID - 10.5820/aian.2902.2022.85 [doi]
AB  - This paper describes the revision of the in-person Strong Men, Strong Communities
      (SMSC) study to a remote protocol and highlights key successes, challenges, and
      critical lessons learned applicable to remote trial implementation. The SMSC
      study is the first randomized controlled trial to exclusively recruit American
      Indian and Alaska Native men into a diabetes prevention intervention. The
      five-year randomized controlled trial was in its 42nd month with 99 subjects
      enrolled when the COVID-19 pandemic ceased all in-person research. The study
      protocol was revised to accommodate remote implementation which required multiple
      protocol and procedural changes, including the use of Facebook for national
      recruitment of participants; alteration of the informed consent process; use of
      REDCap for independent participant completion of informed consent; revised
      eligibility criteria; and use of Zoom to deliver intervention classes. The remote
      study protocol proved superior to the in-person protocol in terms of recruitment,
      retention, engagement in intervention classes, and efficiency of data collection.
      Challenges to participation and retention included competing demands of
      participant's jobs as essential workers and for some, the trauma of the losing a 
      loved one(s) to COVID-19. Future studies are needed to evaluate the effectiveness
      of a remote protocol in the absence of a pandemic.

TI  - The spectrum of diabetes in acute and chronic pancreatitis.
PG  - 509-515
LID - 10.1097/MOG.0000000000000864 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To discuss the spectrum of diabetes related to acute and
      chronic pancreatitis (which are types of pancreatogenic diabetes) and its
      overlapping features with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. RECENT FINDINGS: Patients
      with diabetes related to acute and chronic pancreatitis present clinically within
      a spectrum of overlapping features with other forms of diabetes. In this
      spectrum, glucose metabolism alterations range from increased insulin resistance 
      following acute pancreatitis (resembling type 2 diabetes) towards a permanent
      loss of beta-cell function and impaired insulin secretion in end-stage chronic
      pancreatitis. Overlapping features with type 1 diabetes (beta cell
      autoantibodies) and type 2 diabetes (obesity, dyslipidemia, and
      hereditary/genetic factors) contribute to the heterogeneity of this spectrum.
      SUMMARY: Pancreatogenic diabetes secondary to acute or chronic pancreatitis is a 
      heterogeneous entity with a variable clinical presentation, including many cases 
      that are misdiagnosed and treated as type 2 diabetes. This is problematic as
      pancreatogenic diabetes is associated with a poor prognosis and entails special
      considerations for management. Recent discoveries showing overlapping features
      with type 1 and type 2 diabetes along with an improved understanding of its
      pathophysiology are expected to improve the diagnosis and treatment of these and 
      other forms of pancreatogenic diabetes.

TI  - Effects of Metabolic Medicine and Metabolic Surgery on Patient-Reported Outcomes 
      Among Patients with Type 2 Diabetes.
LID - 10.1089/met.2022.0039 [doi]
AB  - The assessment and management of patient-reported outcomes (PROs) is considered
      secondary to that of cardiometabolic outcomes. When assessed, health-related
      quality of life (HRQOL), a PRO, can yield pertinent information that cannot be
      obtained from cardiometabolic assessments. For instance, physical and mental
      distress can be quantified and treated. Moreover, treatment convenience and
      satisfaction can be gaged. Behavioral modification, bariatric surgery, and
      pharmacotherapy can improve PROs. Typically, HRQOL is responsive to changes in
      weight. Specifically, weight loss and weight gain are associated with positive
      and negative changes in quality of life, respectively. In addition, patient
      satisfaction can be influenced by glycemic control. Therefore, hypoglycemia and
      hyperglycemic episodes can negatively affect patient satisfaction. When managing 
      type 2 diabetes (T2D), it is important to consider how therapies impact PROs.
      Generally, changes in clinical outcomes mirror changes in PROs. To best manage
      T2D, integrating the assessment of PROs with clinical outcomes is needed.

TI  - Association of Variants of the NFE2L2 Gene with Metabolic and Kidney Function
      Parameters in Patients with Diabetes and/or Hypertension.
LID - 10.1089/gtmb.2022.0041 [doi]
AB  - Background: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and high blood pressure (HBP) are the
      main risk factors for chronic kidney disease (CKD). Relationships between
      variants within the NFE2L2 gene and the presence of risk factors for CKD, such as
      HBP and hyperglycemia, have been suggested; however, their role on kidney
      parameters remains unclear. Aim: To analyze the association of NFE2L2 variants
      with metabolic and kidney parameters. Materials and Methods: Six-hundred and
      fifty-one patients grouped according to the diagnosis of T2DM (n = 166), T2DM+HBP
      (n = 348), and HBP (n = 137) were included. Metabolic characteristics were
      evaluated to identify risk factors and presence of CKD. Genotyping was performed 
      by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) coupled to confronting two pair primers for
      rs35652124 and rs6721961 and by real-time PCR for rs2364723. Logistic regression 
      analyses, adjusted by confounding factors and correction for multiple tests, were
      performed. Results: Significant associations of rs35652124 (allele A) and
      rs2364723 (allele G) variants with low risk for presenting CKD were detected.
      Other variables consistently associated with these alleles were HBP, body mass
      index, waist circumference, uric acid, and triglycerides. Haplotypes AAC and GCG 
      (loci order: rs35652124-rs6721961-rs2364723) showed similar trends. After
      adjustment for age and sex and correction for multiple tests, only rs35652124
      (odds ratio [OR] = 0.5; confidence interval at 95% (CI95%), 0.3-0.9; p = 0.04)
      and rs2364723 (OR = 0.3; CI95%, 0.1-0.8; p = 0.009) variants remained associated 
      with low risk for CKD in T2DM patients. Conclusion: This study showed for the
      first time that NFE2L2 variants were associated with low risk for CKD and with
      some traits related to kidney damage, such as HBP, hyperuricemia, and
      albuminuria, in Mexican patients with diabetes.

TI  - The beta-Cell in Type 1 Diabetes Pathogenesis: A Victim of Circumstances or an
      Instigator of Tragic Events?
PG  - 1603-1610
LID - 10.2337/dbi21-0036 [doi]
AB  - Recent reports have revived interest in the active role that beta-cells may play 
      in type 1 diabetes pathogenesis at different stages of disease. In some studies, 
      investigators suggested an initiating role and proposed that type 1 diabetes may 
      be primarily a disease of beta-cells and only secondarily a disease of
      autoimmunity. This scenario is possible and invites the search for environmental 
      triggers damaging beta-cells. Another major contribution of beta-cells may be to 
      amplify autoimmune vulnerability and to eventually drive it into an intrinsic,
      self-detrimental state that turns the T cell-mediated homicide into a beta-cell
      suicide. On the other hand, protective mechanisms are also mounted by beta-cells 
      and may provide novel therapeutic targets to combine immunomodulatory and
      beta-cell protective agents. This integrated view of autoimmunity as a disease of
      T-cell/beta-cell cross talk will ultimately advance our understanding of type 1
      diabetes pathogenesis and improve our chances of preventing or reversing disease 
      progression.

AB  - ABSTRACT: Each year, nearly one-fifth of adults in the United States are
      prescribed at least one psychotropic medication. An increased trend in
      psychiatric polypharmacy has heightened awareness of drug-drug interactions and
      the tracking of adverse drug reactions. This article describes a patient who
      developed concomitant neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) and nephrogenic
      diabetes insipidus during cross-titration of his antipsychotics while on lithium.
      The patient's mild form of NMS in turn caused hypovolemia and acute kidney
      injury. This case study highlights the dangers of polypharmacy and how it can
      obscure the presentation of even classic adverse reactions.

      Left ventricular (LV) function (stroke volume, cardiac output, LV ejection
      fraction, systolic annular velocity (s')), estimated LV filling pressures (E/e'),
      mean pulmonary arterial pressures (mPAP) and mPAP/COslope were assessed at rest, 
      low- and high-intensity exercise with colloid contrast. RESULTS: Groups had
      similar patient characteristics, glycemic control, stroke volume, cardiac output,
      LV ejection fraction and E/e' (p > 0.05). The dyspneic group had significantly
      lower systolic LV reserve at peak exercise (s') (p = 0.021) with a significant
      interaction effect (p < 0.001). The dyspneic group also had significantly higher 
      mPAP and mPAP/CO at rest and exercise (p < 0.001) with significant interaction
      for mPAP (p < 0.009) and insignificant for mPAP/CO (p = 0.385). There was no
      significant difference in mPAP/COslope between groups (p = 0.706). However, about
      61% of dyspneic vs. 30% of non-dyspneic group had mPAP/COslope > 3 (p = 0.009).
      The mPAP/COslope negatively predicted VO2peak in dyspneic group (beta= -1.86, 95%
      CI -2.75, -0.98; multivariate model R(2):0.54). CONCLUSION: Pulmonary
      hypertension and less LV systolic reserve detected by exercise echocardiography
      with colloid contrast underlie unexplained exertional dyspnea and reduced
      exercise capacity in T2DM.

TI  - Effectiveness of a Diabetes-Focused Electronic Discharge Order Set and
      Postdischarge Nursing Support Among Poorly Controlled Hospitalized Patients:
      Randomized Controlled Trial.
PG  - e33401
LID - 10.2196/33401 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although the use of electronic order sets has become standard
      practice for inpatient diabetes management, there is limited decision support at 
      discharge. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we assessed whether an electronic discharge 
      order set (DOS) plus nurse follow-up calls improve discharge orders and
      postdischarge outcomes among hospitalized patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
      METHODS: This was a randomized, open-label, single center study that compared an 
      electronic DOS and nurse phone calls to enhanced standard care (ESC) in
      hospitalized insulin-requiring patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The
      primary outcome was change in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level at 24 weeks after
      discharge. The secondary outcomes included the completeness and accuracy of
      discharge prescriptions related to diabetes. RESULTS: This study was stopped
      early because of feasibility concerns related to the long-term follow-up.
      However, 158 participants were enrolled (DOS: n=82; ESC: n=76), of whom 155 had
      discharge data. The DOS group had a greater frequency of prescriptions for bolus 
      insulin (78% vs 44%; P=.01), needles or syringes (95% vs 63%; P=.03), and
      glucometers (86% vs 36%; P<.001). The clarity of the orders was similar. HbA1c
      data were available for 54 participants in each arm at 12 weeks and for 44 and 45
      participants in the DOS and ESC arms, respectively, at 24 weeks. The unadjusted
      difference in change in HbA1c level (DOS - ESC) was -0.6% (SD 0.4%; P=.18) at 12 
      weeks and -1.1% (SD 0.4%; P=.01) at 24 weeks. The adjusted difference in change
      in HbA1c level was -0.5% (SD 0.4%; P=.20) at 12 weeks and -0.7% (SD 0.4%; P=.09) 
      at 24 weeks. The achievement of the individualized HbA1c target was greater in
      the DOS group at 12 weeks but not at 24 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: An intervention that 
      included a DOS plus a postdischarge nurse phone call resulted in more complete
      discharge prescriptions. The assessment of postdischarge outcomes was limited,
      owing to the loss of the long-term follow-up, but it suggested a possible benefit
      in glucose control. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03455985;

TI  - Insulin Glargine 300 U/mL Therapy in Children and Adolescents with Type 1
      Diabetes.
LID - 10.1007/s40272-022-00520-3 [doi]
AB  - The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of the second-generation basal
      insulin glargine 300 Units/mL (Gla-300) may be of benefit in the treatment of
      type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Gla-300 provides a stable and sustained
      time-action profile, which is associated with glycaemic control and flexible
      dosing schedule. This review summarises the available evidence on the safety and 
      efficacy of Gla-300 in children and adolescents with T1DM. Gla-300 is as
      effective as the first-generation basal insulin glargine 100 Units/mL (Gla-100), 
      a standard of care for patients with diabetes in reducing HbA1c, and shows a
      lower risk of severe hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia in children and adolescents
      with T1DM. However, Gla-300 and Gla-100 are not bioequivalent and are not
      directly interchangeable. Real-world studies on patients aged 6-17 years are
      limited. To date, only one small study assessed the effectiveness and safety of
      Gla-300 versus Gla-100 in newly diagnosed T1DM paediatric patients, confirming
      the treatment safety and effectiveness of Gla-300 in clinical practice. Gla-300
      is a longer-acting basal insulin alternative in the management of children (aged 
      >/= 6 years) and adolescents with T1DM.

OAB - The smooth and prolonged activity of insulin glargine 300 Units/mL (Gla-300), a
      second-generation basal insulin, results in a stable and sustained glycaemic
      control while allowing flexible dosing times. In children aged >/= 6 years and
      adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), Gla-300 provides a glycaemic
      control comparable to that of glargine 100 Units/mL (Gla-100), a standard of care
      in patients with T1DM. Gla-300 and Gla-100 show similar safety profiles, with
      Gla-300 resulting in a clinically relevant trend towards a lower incidence of
      hyperglycaemia with ketosis and a lower incidence and event rate of severe
      hypoglycaemia in children and adolescents with T1DM. Overall, these two insulins 
      are similar, but not interchangeable. To the best of our knowledge, only one
      real-world study has addressed the effectiveness and safety of Gla-300 compared
      to Gla-100 in newly diagnosed T1DM paediatric patients, and it has shown the
      therapeutic benefits of Gla-300 in clinical practice.

TI  - Susceptibility of renal fibrosis in diabetes: Role of hypoxia inducible factor-1.
PG  - e22477
LID - 10.1096/fj.202200845R [doi]
AB  - Diabetes may prevent kidney repair and sensitize the kidney to fibrosis or scar
      formation. To test this possibility, we examined renal fibrosis induced by
      unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) in diabetic mouse models. Indeed, UUO
      induced significantly more renal fibrosis in both Akita and STZ-induced diabetic 
      mice than in nondiabetic mice. The diabetic mice also had more apoptosis and
      interstitial macrophage infiltration during UUO. In vitro, hypoxia induced higher
      expression of the fibrosis marker protein fibronectin in high glucose-conditioned
      renal tubular cells than in normal glucose cells. Mechanistically, hypoxia
      induced significantly more hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) in high
      glucose cells than in normal glucose cells. Inhibition of HIF-1 attenuated the
      expression of fibronectin induced by hypoxia in high-glucose cells. Consistently,
      UUO induced significantly higher HIF-1alpha expression along with fibrosis in
      diabetic mice kidneys than in nondiabetic kidneys. The increased expression of
      fibrosis induced by UUO in diabetic mice was diminished in proximal
      tubule-HIF-1alpha-knockout mice. Together, these results indicate that diabetes
      sensitizes kidney tissues and cells to fibrogenesis probably by enhancing HIF-1
      activation.

TI  - Index60 Is Superior to HbA1c for Identifying Individuals at High Risk for Type 1 
      Diabetes.
LID - dgac440 [pii]
LID - 10.1210/clinem/dgac440 [doi]
AB  - AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: A HbA1c range of >/=5.7% to <6.5% (39-46 mmol/mol) indicates
      prediabetes according to American Diabetes Association (ADA) guidelines, yet its 
      identification of individuals with prediabetes specific for type 1 diabetes has
      not been assessed. A composite glucose and C-peptide measure, Index60, identifies
      individuals at high risk for type 1 diabetes. We compared Index60 and HbA1c
      thresholds as markers for type 1 diabetes risk. METHODS: TrialNet Pathway to
      Prevention study participants with >/=2 autoantibodies (GADA, IAA, IA2A, or
      ZnT8A) who had oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT) and HbA1c measurements
      underwent 1) predictive time-dependent modeling of type 1 diabetes risk (n=2,776)
      and 2) baseline comparisons between high-risk mutually exclusive groups:
      Index60>/=2.04 (n=268) vs. HbA1c>/=5.7% (n=268). The Index60>/=2.04 threshold was
      commensurate in ordinal ranking with the standard prediabetes threshold of
      HbA1c>/=5.7%. RESULTS: In mutually exclusive groups, individuals exceeding
      Index60>/=2.04 had a higher cumulative incidence of type 1 diabetes than those
      exceeding HbA1c>/=5.7% (p<0.0001). Appreciably more individuals with
      Index60>/=2.04 were at stage 2, and among those at stage 2, the cumulative
      incidence was higher for those with Index60>/=2.04 (p=0.02). Those with
      Index60>/=2.04 were younger, with lower BMI, greater autoantibody number, and
      lower C-peptide than those with HbA1c>/=5.7% (p<0.0001 for all comparisons).
      CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Individuals with Index60>/=2.04 are at greater risk
      for type 1 diabetes with features more characteristic of the disorder than those 
      with HbA1c>/=5.7%. Index60>/=2.04 is superior to the standard HbA1c>/=5.7%
      threshold for identifying prediabetes in autoantibody positive individuals. These
      findings appear to justify using Index60>/=2.04 as a prediabetes criterion in
      this population.

TI  - Physical Function in Middle-aged and Older Adults With Type 1 Diabetes: Long-term
      Follow-up of the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial/Epidemiology of
      Diabetes Interventions and Complications Study.
LID - dc212119 [pii]
LID - 10.2337/dc21-2119 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the prevalence and clinical correlates of functional
      limitations in middle-aged and older adults with long-standing type 1 diabetes.
      RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Functional limitations were assessed for 1,094
      participants in the Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications
      (EDIC) study, a multicenter, longitudinal, observational follow-up of
      participants with type 1 diabetes randomly assigned to intensive or conventional 
      diabetes therapy during the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT). The 
      primary outcome measure was a score <10 on the Short Physical Performance Battery
      (SPPB). The secondary outcome, self-reported functional limitation, was assessed 
      by written questionnaire. Logistic regression models were used to assess
      associations of both outcomes with demographic and clinical factors (glycemic and
      nonglycemic factors, micro- and macrovascular complications, DCCT cohort, and
      treatment assignment). RESULTS: Participants were 53% male, with mean +/- SD age 
      59.5 +/- 6.8 years and diabetes duration 37.9 +/- 4.9 years. The prevalence of
      SPPB score <10 was 21%. The prevalence of self-reported functional limitations
      was 48%. While DCCT treatment assignment was not associated with physical
      function outcomes measured approximately 25 years after the end of the DCCT, the 
      time-weighted mean DCCT/EDIC HbA1c was associated with both outcomes. Other
      clinical factors associated with both outcomes in multivariable analyses were
      BMI, general psychological distress, and cardiac autonomic neuropathy.
      CONCLUSIONS: Almost half of the middle-aged and older adults with long-standing
      type 1 diabetes reported functional limitations, which were associated with
      higher HbA1c and BMI, general psychological distress, and cardiac autonomic
      neuropathy. Future research is needed to determine whether these findings are
      generalizable.

TI  - Lifestyle Intervention Strategy to Treat Diabetes in Older Adults: A Randomized
      Controlled Trial.
LID - dc220338 [pii]
LID - 10.2337/dc22-0338 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Lifestyle intervention is recommended as first-line treatment of
      diabetes at all ages; however, little is known about the efficacy of lifestyle
      intervention in older adults with diabetes. We aimed to determine whether
      lifestyle intervention would improve glycemic control and age-relevant outcomes
      in older adults with diabetes and comorbidities. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A
      total of 100 older adults with diabetes were randomly assigned to 1-year
      intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) (diet and exercise at a facility
      transitioned into community-fitness centers and homes) or healthy lifestyle (HL) 
      group. The primary outcome was change in HbA1c. Secondary outcomes included
      glucoregulation, body composition, physical function, and quality of life.
      Changes between groups were analyzed with mixed-model repeated-measures ANCOVA
      following the intention-to-treat principle. RESULTS: HbA1c improved more in the
      ILI than the HL group (mean +/- SE -0.8 +/- 0.1 vs. 0.1 +/- 0.1%), associated
      with improved insulin sensitivity (1.2 +/- 0.2 vs. -0.4 +/- 0.2) and disposition 
      (26.0 +/- 8.9 vs -13.0 +/- 8.4 109 min-1) indices (between-group P < 0.001 to
      0.04). Body weight and visceral fat decreased more in the ILI than HL group (-8.4
      +/- 0.6 vs. -0.3 +/- 0.6 kg, P < 0.001, and -261 +/- 29 vs. -30 +/- 27 cm3, P <
      0.001, respectively). Physical Performance Test score increased more in the ILI
      than HL group (2.9 +/- 0.6 vs. -0.1 +/- 0.4, P < 0.001) as did VO2peak (2.2 +/-
      0.3 vs. -1.2 +/- 0.2 mL/kg/min, P < 0.001). Strength, gait, and 36-Item Short
      Form Survey (SF-36) Physical Component Summary score also improved more in the
      ILI group (all P < 0.001). Total insulin dose decreased in the ILI group by 19.8 
      +/- 4.4 units/day. Adverse events included increased episodes of mild
      hypoglycemia in the ILI group. CONCLUSIONS: A lifestyle intervention strategy is 
      highly successful in improving metabolic and functional health of older adults
      with diabetes.

      Using e-Health Record Linkage in Scotland.
LID - dc220385 [pii]
LID - 10.2337/dc22-0385 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Studies using claims databases reported that SARS-CoV-2 infection >30 
      days earlier was associated with an increase in the incidence of type 1 diabetes.
      Using exact dates of diabetes diagnosis from the national register in Scotland
      linked to virology laboratory data, we sought to replicate this finding. RESEARCH
      DESIGN AND METHODS: A cohort of 1,849,411 individuals aged <35 years without
      diabetes, including all those in Scotland who subsequently tested positive for
      SARS-CoV-2, was followed from 1 March 2020 to 22 November 2021. Incident type 1
      diabetes was ascertained from the national registry. Using Cox regression, we
      tested the association of time-updated infection with incident diabetes. Trends
      in incidence of type 1 diabetes in the population from 2015 through 2021 were
      also estimated in a generalized additive model. RESULTS: There were 365,080
      individuals who had at least one detected SARS-CoV-2 infection during follow-up
      and 1074 who developed type 1 diabetes. The rate ratio for incident type 1
      diabetes associated with first positive test for SARS-CoV-2 (reference category: 
      no previous infection) was 0.86 (95% CI 0.62, 1.21) for infection >30 days
      earlier and 2.62 (95% CI 1.81, 3.78) for infection in the previous 30 days.
      However, negative and positive SARS-CoV-2 tests were more frequent in the days
      surrounding diabetes presentation. In those aged 0-14 years, incidence of type 1 
      diabetes during 2020-2021 was 20% higher than the 7-year average. CONCLUSIONS:
      Type 1 diabetes incidence in children increased during the pandemic. However, the
      cohort analysis suggests that SARS-CoV-2 infection itself was not the cause of
      this increase.

TI  - Circular RNA-VPS13A attenuates diabetes-induced enteric glia damage by targeting 
      miR-182/GDNF Axis.
PG  - 1-9
LID - 10.3724/abbs.2022073 [doi]
AB  - Gastrointestinal (GI) complications of diabetes mellitus (DM) significantly
      impact on patients' quality of life. Enteric glial cells (EGC) are the key cell
      type of enteric nervous system (ENS), which contributes to the destruction of gut
      homeostasis in DM. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a novel type of RNAs abundant in 
      the eukaryotic transcriptome, which form covalently closed continuous loops. In
      this study, the contribution of circRNAs to EGC damage in DM is investigated.
      Transcriptome sequencing analysis and functional study show that circVPS13A is
      significantly down-regulated in hyperglycemia-treated EGC, and circVPS13A
      overexpression attenuates EGC damage in both in vitro and in vivo DM models. In
      vitro mechanistic study using dual-luciferase reporter assay, affinity-isolation 
      assay, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and immunostaining analysis
      identify that circVPS13A exerts its protective effect by sponging miR-182 and
      then up-regulates glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) expression. 
      In addition, in vivo study confirms that the circVPS13A-miR-182-GDNF network
      regulation can attenuate hyperglycemia-induced EGC damage of duodenum in
      streptozotocine (STZ)-induced DM mice. The findings of this study may provide
      novel insights into the protective role of circVPS13A in DM-associated EGC damage
      and clues for the development of new therapeutic approaches for the prevention of
      GI complications of DM.

TI  - The impact of interprofessional education on students' current and desired
      competence in diabetes care.
LID - 10.1002/nop2.1301 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To explore the impact of interprofessional education (IPE) on undergraduate 
      nursing and medical students' knowledge, competence and targeted competence in
      diabetes care. DESIGN: Mixed methods design. METHODS: A voluntary IPE course of
      diabetes management was organized for nursing (n = 15) and medical (n = 15)
      students, who performed a diabetes knowledge test and self-evaluation of diabetes
      competence before and after the course and were compared with non-participating
      students. The participating students' focus-group interviews were analysed using 
      inductive content analysis. RESULTS: The IPE course improved nursing students'
      diabetes knowledge and self-evaluated competence among nursing and medical
      students. The baseline differences in self-evaluated competence between the
      groups disappeared. The non-participating students evaluated their competence
      higher than the participants, though they scored lower or equally in the
      knowledge test. In conclusion, IPE showed potential in increasing students'
      self-evaluated competence, motivation to learn more and nursing students'
      diabetes knowledge, offering better prospects for future interprofessional
      diabetes management.

AB  - Method: Thirty-two pregnant women aged 25-35 who were hospitalized in Shanxi
      Maternal and Child Health Hospital from January 2019 to December 2019 were
      included for evaluation, including 15 normal pregnant women (NG_NO group), 6
      pregnant women with GDM alone (G_NO group), and 7 pregnant women with overweight 
      alone (NG_O group). Stools were collected from pregnant women at 24 and 37 weeks 
      of gestation and newborns' first meconium. The v3-v4 variable region of the gut
      flora 16s rRNA was double-ended sequenced and bioinformatically analyzed using
      the Illumina MiSeq PE300 sequencing platform. Results: In the third trimester of 
      pregnancy, there were significant differences in the composition of intestinal
      flora between the simple overweight group, simple GDM group, and normal pregnant 
      group. From the second trimester to the third trimester, there was no significant
      change in the relative distribution of intestinal flora at the phyla
      classification level in normal pregnant women. The relative distribution of
      intestinal flora at the phylum level of newborns was significantly different from
      that of their mothers. The characteristic intestinal microbes of newborns in
      simple GDM group were g_Diaphorobacter, while the simple recombinant neonates
      were Nocardiaceae (f_Nocardioidaceae). In addition, the results showed
      significant differences in intestinal flora among the normal pregnant women
      group, simple GDM group, simple overweight group, and GDM overweight group. The
      results of beta diversity analysis showed a significant difference in intestinal 
      microflora species composition structure between the simple overweight group and 
      the normal pregnant group in the second trimester of pregnancy. The species
      composition structure of intestinal flora was similar between the simple GDM
      group and the normal pregnant group. In the third trimester of pregnancy, there
      was no significant difference in the beta diversity index among the groups, and
      the composition and structure of intestinal flora were similar. There were
      significant differences in the composition structure (beta diversity) of
      intestinal flora between pregnant women and their newborns in each group (P <
      0.05). Correlation analysis showed that the blood glucose values of oral glucose 
      tolerance test (OGTT)_1 h and OGTT_2 h were positively correlated with
      Bacteroides (Bacteroides) and negatively correlated with Proteus (Prevotella),
      prepregnancy BMI was negatively correlated with Bacteroides, and weight gain
      during pregnancy was negatively correlated with Vibrio (Desulfovibrio) in
      Proteus. The birth weight of newborns was positively correlated with
      Actinomycetes (Actinomyces), Bacteroides (Faecalibacterium), and microbacilli
      (Dialister) and negatively correlated with Rolston (Ralstonia). Conclusion: Gut
      microbiota is strongly linked to obesity and gestational diabetes.

AB  - Methods: A cross-sectional study was carried out for over 4 months from May to
      August 2020 using a self-administered, anonymous online questionnaire. All adults
      of both genders were invited to participate in the study. Individuals who are
      able to read and understand the English language were included in the study. Data
      were descriptively analyzed using a statistical package for social science
      version 26 (SPSS). Results: A total of 427 subjects responded to the
      questionnaires. More than half of them were male 253 (59.3%), while 174 (40.7%)
      were female, approximately 49% had a university degree, and 196 (45.9%) were
      postgraduates. The mean age of the participants was 25.7 +/- 6.2 (mean +/- SD).
      Most of them were single 230 (53.9%). The majority of the respondents 367 (85.9%)
      had heard of hyperglycemia, while a comparable number of 366 (85.7%) were aware
      of it being a lifelong disease. About 305 (71.4%) of participants knew that
      genetic factors were associated with hyperglycemia, and more than half of 250
      (58.5%) knew that diabetes causes foot problems. There was a significant
      association between the cause of diabetes with income and educational status (p <
      0.05) and diabetic complications with age, education, and family income (p <
      0.05). Conclusion: In conclusion, there is a need for greater awareness and
      additional education regarding hyperglycemia among the general community in the
      state of Telangana, India, to reduce the incidence of diabetes and associated
      risk factors. Public health campaigns that encourage healthier lifestyles might
      help achieve this aim.

AB  - Purpose To evaluate the impact of pharmacist-led diabetes care in a Home-Based
      Primary Care (HBPC) setting. Methods This was a single-center, retrospective,
      cohort chart review in HBPC veterans with diabetes mellitus type 2 (DMII) at
      Columbia VA Health Care System. A sample size of 80 patients was calculated to
      meet power of 80% and a P-value of less than 0.05 was used to determine clinical 
      significance. The primary outcome was mean hemoglobin A1C (HgbA1C) change after
      up to 18 months of Clinical Pharmacy Specialist (CPS) diabetes-led care
      stratified by baseline HgbA1C. Secondary outcomes included change in the number
      of diabetes medications and doses per day stratified by baseline HgbA1C. Results 
      One hundred twelve patients were included in the final analysis based on
      inclusion and exclusion criteria. The mean absolute HgbA1C reduction was 0.51%,
      95% CI -0.20 to -0.82 from 8.1% at baseline. For the subgroup analyses, patients 
      with baseline HgbA1C less than 8.5%, had a nonsignificant increase in their
      HgbA1C, while patients with HgbA1C 8.5% or more showed significant reductions in 
      HgbA1C (P < 0.05). Patients with baseline HgbA1C less than 6.5% had a significant
      decrease of 0.52, 95% CI -0.18 to -0.87 and patients with baseline HgbA1C 6.5% or
      more had a nonsignificant increase in the number of diabetes medications (P >
      0.05). Patients with baseline HgbA1C of less than 7.5% and 9.5% or more had a
      decrease in the number of diabetes medication doses with results being
      significant for patients with HgbA1C less than 6.5%, 95% CI -0.58 to -1.89.
      Conclusion The results of this study suggest that HBPC CPSs are improving
      glycemic control in HBPC veterans while simplifying diabetic regimens with
      attention to hypoglycemic risk reduction.

AB  - Background An 81-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes, residing in a long-term
      care facility, has experienced a fall after medication changes, and a few days of
      irregular eating. Assessment This patient may be experiencing one or more common 
      potential adverse events related to her diabetes medications. There is a need to 
      create individualized treatment goals in this case. Outcome After a revision of
      treatment goals for hypertension and diabetes, and adjustments to the medication 
      regimen, there have been no subsequent falls and this patient reports that she
      feels better. Conclusion As the person with diabetes ages, quality of life should
      be considered when setting treatment goals. Older people can be more at risk for 
      adverse effects of medications to treat diabetes, so a clinician should be
      vigilant in the identification, management, and prevention of such adverse
      events. Inter-professional communication is key to the safe and effective
      treatment of diabetes.

TI  - Advanced glycation end products and diabetes and other metabolic indicators.
PG  - 104
LID - 10.1186/s13098-022-00873-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetes is a global concern among adults. Previous studies have
      suggested an association between different screening methods and diabetes;
      however, increasing evidence has suggested the importance of early screening for 
      diabetes mellitus (DM) and its influencing factors. In this study, we aimed to
      explore whether the non-invasive detection of advanced glycation end products
      (AGEs) in the early screening of DM in the Chinese community and whether body
      mass index (BMI) and metabolic indexes could moderate this relationship. METHODS:
      Three community health service centers in Hefei that signed the medical
      consortium agreement with the First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical
      University were selected to screen the population aged 30-90 years in each
      community using a multi-stage cluster sampling method from January 2018 to
      January 2019. Univariate analysis of variance was used to compare the differences
      in general data, biochemical indexes, skin AGEs levels, and blood glucose among
      groups. In addition, a multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed. 
      RESULTS: A total of 912 patients with a community health physical examination and
      no history of diabetes were selected, excluding those with missing values > 5%.
      Finally, 906 samples were included in the study with an effective rate of 99.3%. 
      The prevalence in the normal, impaired glucose tolerance, and DM groups were
      79.8%, 10.0%, and 10.2%, respectively. By dividing AGE by quartile, AGE
      accumulation was classified as </= P25, P25-P50, P50-P75, and > P75. Higher AGE
      accumulation (chi(2) = 37.95), BMI (chi(2) = 12.20), systolic blood pressure
      (SBP) (chi(2) = 8.46), triglyceride (TG) (chi(2) = 6.23), and older age (chi(2) =
      20.11) were more likely to have a higher prevalence of fasting blood glucose
      (FBG). The analyses revealed significant correlations between AGE accumulation,
      BMI, TG, total cholesterol (TC), and FBG (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: As the findings 
      indicate, priority should be given to the quality of metabolic-related
      indicators, such as BMI, TG, and TC, employed to effectively reduce the FBG of
      Chinese participants with high AGE accumulation. Skin autofluorescence may prove 
      to be a rapid and non-invasive method for assessing the metabolic progression of 
      all glucose level layers.

TI  - The Potential of Semaglutide Once-Weekly in Patients Without Type 2 Diabetes with
      Weight Regain or Insufficient Weight Loss After Bariatric Surgery-a Retrospective
      Analysis.
LID - 10.1007/s11695-022-06211-9 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: About 20-25% of patients experience weight regain (WR) or insufficient
      weight loss (IWL) after bariatric metabolic surgery (BS). Therefore, we aimed to 
      retrospectively assess the effectiveness of adjunct treatment with the GLP-1
      receptor agonist semaglutide in non-diabetic patients with WR or IWL after BS.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Post-bariatric patients without type 2 diabetes (T2D) with
      WR or IWL (n = 44) were included in the analysis. The primary endpoint was weight
      loss 3 and 6 months after initiation of adjunct treatment. Secondary endpoints
      included change in BMI, HbA1c, lipid profile, hs-CRP, and liver enzymes. RESULTS:
      Patients started semaglutide 64.7 +/- 47.6 months (mean +/- SD) after BS. At
      initiation of semaglutide, WR after post-bariatric weight nadir was 12.3 +/-
      14.4% (mean +/- SD). Total weight loss during semaglutide treatment was - 6.0 +/-
      4.3% (mean +/- SD, p < 0.001) after 3 months (3.2 months, IQR 3.0-3.5, n = 38)
      and - 10.3 +/- 5.5% (mean +/- SD, p < 0.001) after 6 months (5.8 months, IQR
      5.8-6.4, n = 20). At 3 months, categorical weight loss was > 5% in 61% of
      patients, > 10% in 16% of patients, and > 15% in 2% of patients. Triglycerides
      (OR = 0.99; p < 0.05), ALT (OR = 0.87; p = 0.05), and AST (OR = 0.89; p < 0.05)
      at baseline were negatively associated with weight loss of at least 5% at 3
      months' follow-up (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Treatment options to manage
      post-bariatric excess weight (regain) are scarce. Our results imply a clear
      benefit of adjunct treatment with semaglutide in post-bariatric patients.
      However, these results need to be confirmed in a prospective randomized
      controlled trial to close the gap between lifestyle intervention and revision
      surgery in patients with IWL or WR after BS.

TI  - Impact of pharmacological treatment of gestational diabetes on the mode of
      delivery and birth weight: a nationwide population-based study on a subset of
      singleton pregnant Portuguese women.
LID - 10.1007/s00592-022-01931-x [doi]
AB  - AIMS: To access the impact of increasing use of metformin on cesarean section and
      large for gestational age rates, when compared to insulin. METHODS: A
      retrospective observational study was developed using data from the Portuguese
      National Registry, between 2011 and 2019, of 5038 Portuguese women with single
      pregnancies and gestational diabetes treated with metformin and/or insulin. Three
      groups were defined according to the therapeutic regimen adopted: g1-insulin in
      monotherapy (n = 3027[60.1%]); g2-metformin in monotherapy (n = 1366[27.1%]);
      g3-metformin and insulin (n = 645[12.8%]). Multivariate analysis was adjusted for
      statistically significant covariates. RESULTS: The cesarean section rate in g1
      was similar to g2 (g1:36.9% vs. g2:37%, p = 0.982), although g3 was associated
      with cesarean delivery (g3:43.6% vs. g1:36.9%, p = 0.005; g3:43.6% vs. g1:37.0%, 
      p = 0.002), with no differences reported in the multivariate analysis adjusted
      for year of delivery and pregestational body mass index. A delivery of a large
      for gestational age newborn was less frequently observed in g2 than in g1
      (g2:4.1% vs. g1:5.4%, p = 0.044) and in g3 (g2:4.1% vs. g3:9.1%, p < 0.001), and 
      in g1, when compared to g3 (g1:5.4% vs. g3:9.1%, p < 0.001). In the multivariate 
      analysis, g2 showed lower odds of delivering a large for gestational age newborn,
      compared to g1 (beta = -0.511, OR = 0.596, CI95% = 0.428-0.832, p < 0.001).
      CONCLUSIONS: The use of metformin was not associated with higher cesarean section
      rates, compared to insulin. Instead, it was suggested a protective role of
      metformin on large gestational age rates. The concomitant use of dual therapy
      suggests more complex pregnancies, requiring closer surveillance that mitigate
      serious perinatal and obstetrical outcomes.

      diabetes mellitus. Findings from the EPICTER study.

LID - 10.1016/j.ejim.2022.07.014 [doi]
AB  - AIM: This work aims to compare the characteristics of advanced heart failure (HF)
      in patients with and without type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) and to determine the
      relevance of variables used to define advanced HF. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This
      cross-sectional, multicenter study included patients hospitalized for HF. They
      were classified into four groups according to presence/absence of advanced HF,
      determined based on general and cardiac criteria, and presence/absence of DM. To 
      analyze the importance of variables, we grew a random forest algorithm (RF) based
      on mortality at six months. RESULTS: A total of 3153 patients were included. The 
      prevalence of advanced HF among patients with DM was 24% compared to 23% among
      those without DM (p=0.53). Patients with advanced HF and DM had more comorbidity 
      related to cardiovascular and renal diseases; their prognosis was the poorest
      (log-rank <0.0001) though the adjusted hazard ratio by group in the Cox
      regression analysis was not significant. The variables that were significantly
      related to mortality were the number of comorbidities (p=0.005) and systolic
      blood pressure (p=0.024). The RF showed that general criteria were more important
      for defining advanced HF than cardiac criteria. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with
      advanced HF and DM were characterized by DM in progression with macro and
      microvascular complications. The outcomes among advanced HF patients were poor;
      patients with advanced HF and DM had the poorest outcomes. General criteria were 
      the most important to establish accurately a definition of advanced HF, being
      decisive the evidence of disease progression in patients with DM.

PG  - 440-449
LID - 10.9758/cpn.2022.20.3.440 [doi]
AB  - Objective: This study aimed to compare the mean pulse rate (PR) and mean blood
      pressure (BP) between patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and those with 
      simple snoring (SS) during a 24-hour period, and to investigate the correlation
      between apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), PR, and BP in sleep-related breathing
      disorder (SRBD) patients with and without hypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM),
      and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Methods: Ninety SRBD patients underwent
      full-night polysomnography, and ambulatory BP and PR were monitored for 24 hours.
      Participants were classified into OSA (AHI >/= 5) and control (SS) (AHI < 5)
      groups, and BP and PR were compared. Participants were also divided into groups
      with and without hypertension, CVDs, or DM to analyze the correlation between
      AHI, BP, and PR in each group. Results: Mean PRs during the daytime period and
      during the whole 24-hour period in the OSA group were significantly higher than
      those in the SS group after controlling for potential confounders. No significant
      difference was observed in mean BP between the groups. Partial correlation
      analysis after controlling for confounders showed significant correlation between
      AHI and PR during daytime and the 24-hour period in participants without
      hypertension, DM, or CVDs, but not in participants with these conditions.
      Conclusion: The significant differences and correlations only in PR (not in BP)
      found in this study suggest that PR could be an early marker for SRBD in
      individuals without comorbidities, and that an increased sympathetic tone could
      be responsible for future occurrence of CVD.

      study: rationale and design of a randomised controlled study.
PG  - e054313
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2021-054313 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Bariatric surgery is an effective method of controlling glycaemia
      in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obesity. Long-term studies
      suggest that although glycaemic control remains good, only 20%-40% of patients
      will maintain remission according to the American Diabetes Association criteria. 
      PURPOSE: This trial aims to examine the safety and efficacy of combining
      Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy with goal-directed medical therapy
      to improve long-term glycaemic control of T2DM. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This
      prospective, open-label multicentre randomised controlled trial (RCT) will
      recruit 150 patients with obesity and T2DM from tertiary care obesity centres.
      Patients will be randomised 1:1 to receive either bariatric surgery and standard 
      medical care or bariatric surgery and intensive goal-directed medical therapy,
      titrated to specific targets for glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), blood pressure
      (BP) and low-density lipoproteins (LDL) cholesterol. The primary endpoints are
      the proportion of patients in each arm with an HbA1c<6.5% (48 mmol/mol) at 1 year
      and the proportion of patients in each arm achieving the composite endpoint of
      HbA1c<6.5% (48 mmol/mol), BP<130/80 mm Hg and LDL<2.6 mmol/L at 5 years. ETHICS
      AND DISSEMINATION: The local institutional review board approved this study. This
      study represents the first RCT to examine the safety and efficacy of combining
      bariatric surgery with intensive medical therapy compared with bariatric surgery 
      and usual care for long-term diabetes control. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER:

AB  - Endothelial dysfunction represents a key mechanism underlying heart failure with 
      preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), diabetes mellitus (DM), and frailty.
      However, reliable biomarkers to monitor endothelial dysfunction in these patients
      are lacking. In this study, we evaluated the expression of a panel of circulating
      microRNAs (miRs) involved in the regulation of endothelial function in frail
      older adults with HFpEF and DM that were treated for 3 months with empagliflozin,
      metformin, or insulin. We identified a unique pattern of miRs that were
      significantly regulated in HFpEF patients compared to healthy controls and in
      HFpEF patients after treatment with the SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin. Three miRs
      were significantly downregulated (miR-126, miR-342-3p, and miR-638) and two were 
      significantly upregulated (miR-21 and miR-92) in HFpEF patients compared to
      healthy controls. Strikingly, two of these miRs (miR-21 and miR-92) were
      significantly reduced in HFpEF patients after the 3-month treatment with
      empagliflozin whereas no significant differences in the profile of endothelial
      miRNAs were detected in patients treated with metformin or insulin. Significance 
      Statement We have identified for the first time a signature of microRNA
      functionally involved in the regulation of endothelial function that is
      significantly regulated in frail patients with HFpEF and diabetes. The treatment 
      with the SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin caused a modification of some microRNA in 
      a direction that was opposite to what observed in HFpEF patients, indicating a
      rescue of endothelial function. Our findings are relevant inasmuch as novel
      biomarkers of disease as well as response to therapy have been established.

AB  - AIMS: To compare the safety and efficacy of insulin detemir versus neutral
      protamine Hagedorn (NPH) in pregnant women with diabetes. METHODS: MEDLINE,
      CENTRAL, Google Scholar databases, and ClinicalTrials.gov registry were searched 
      from inception to December 2021 to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs)
      concerning adult women with singleton pregnancies, gestational or pregestational 
      diabetes, and the need for insulin therapy. A systematic review and a
      meta-analysis (weighted data, random-effects model) were performed. Continuous
      outcomes were expressed as mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence interval (CI)
      (inverse variance method); dichotomous outcomes were expressed as risk ratio (RR)
      with 95% CI (Mantel-Haenszel method). Heterogeneity was quantified using the I(2)
      index. RESULTS: Five RCTs involving 1450 participants met the inclusion criteria.
      Outcomes that showed significant results in favor of insulin detemir over NPH
      were maternal hypoglycemic events (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.48-0.86, p = 0.003; I(2) =
      0%) and gestational age at delivery (MD 0.48, 95% CI 0.16-0.81, p = 0.003; I(2) =
      0%). CONCLUSIONS: Insulin detemir was associated with less maternal hypoglycemic 
      events and decreased risk for prematurity compared with NPH insulin. More
      research should be conducted to reach a safe conclusion about the optimal insulin
      regimen for women with diabetes in pregnancy.

TI  - Blood pressure-lowering treatment for prevention of major cardiovascular diseases
      in people with and without type 2 diabetes: an individual participant-level data 
      meta-analysis.
LID - S2213-8587(22)00172-3 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/S2213-8587(22)00172-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Controversy exists as to whether the threshold for blood
      pressure-lowering treatment should differ between people with and without type 2 
      diabetes. We aimed to investigate the effects of blood pressure-lowering
      treatment on the risk of major cardiovascular events by type 2 diabetes status,
      as well as by baseline levels of systolic blood pressure. METHODS: We conducted a
      one-stage individual participant-level data meta-analysis of major randomised
      controlled trials using the Blood Pressure Lowering Treatment Trialists'
      Collaboration dataset. Trials with information on type 2 diabetes status at
      baseline were eligible if they compared blood pressure-lowering medications
      versus placebo or other classes of blood pressure-lowering medications, or an
      intensive versus a standard blood pressure-lowering strategy, and reported at
      least 1000 persons-years of follow-up in each group. Trials exclusively on
      participants with heart failure or with short-term therapies and acute myocardial
      infarction or other acute settings were excluded. We expressed treatment effect
      per 5 mm Hg reduction in systolic blood pressure on the risk of developing a
      major cardiovascular event as the primary outcome, defined as the first
      occurrence of fatal or non-fatal stroke or cerebrovascular disease, fatal or
      non-fatal ischaemic heart disease, or heart failure causing death or requiring
      hospitalisation. Cox proportional hazard models, stratified by trial, were used
      to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) separately by type 2 diabetes status at baseline,
      with further stratification by baseline categories of systolic blood pressure (in
      10 mm Hg increments from <120 mm Hg to >/=170 mm Hg). To estimate absolute risk
      reductions, we used a Poisson regression model over the follow-up duration. The
      effect of each of the five major blood pressure-lowering drug classes, including 
      angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, beta 
      blockers, calcium channel blockers, and thiazide diuretics, was estimated using a
      network meta-analysis framework. This study is registered with PROSPERO,
      CRD42018099283. FINDINGS: We included data from 51 randomised clinical trials
      published between 1981 and 2014 involving 358 533 participants (58% men), among
      whom 103 325 (29%) had known type 2 diabetes at baseline. The baseline mean
      systolic/diastolic blood pressure of those with and without type 2 diabetes was
      149/84 mm Hg (SD 19/11) and 153/88 mm Hg (SD 21/12), respectively. Over 4.2 years
      median follow-up (IQR 3.0-5.0), a 5 mm Hg reduction in systolic blood pressure
      decreased the risk of major cardiovascular events in both groups, but with a
      weaker relative treatment effect in participants with type 2 diabetes (HR 0.94
      [95% CI 0.91-0.98]) compared with those without type 2 diabetes (0.89
      [0.87-0.92]; pinteraction=0.0013). However, absolute risk reductions did not
      differ substantially between people with and without type 2 diabetes because of
      the higher absolute cardiovascular risk among participants with type 2 diabetes. 
      We found no reliable evidence for heterogeneity of treatment effects by baseline 
      systolic blood pressure in either group. In keeping with the primary findings,
      analysis using stratified network meta-analysis showed no evidence that relative 
      treatment effects differed substantially between participants with type 2
      diabetes and those without for any of the drug classes investigated.
      INTERPRETATION: Although the relative beneficial effects of blood pressure
      reduction on major cardiovascular events were weaker in participants with type 2 
      diabetes than in those without, absolute effects were similar. The difference in 
      relative risk reduction was not related to the baseline blood pressure or
      allocation to different drug classes. Therefore, the adoption of differential
      blood pressure thresholds, intensities of blood pressure lowering, or drug
      classes used in people with and without type 2 diabetes is not warranted.

TI  - The association of objectively and subjectively measured physical activity and
      sedentary time with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes in adults: A cross-sectional 
      study in Framingham Heart Study cohorts.
LID - 10.1139/apnm-2022-0232 [doi]
AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine whether using both objectively
      (accelerometer) and subjectively (questionnaire) measured moderate- to
      vigorous-intensity physical activity (MVPA) and sedentary time (SED) improves the
      prediction of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes (pre/T2D) using data from the
      Framingham Heart Study (n=4200). Logistic regression was used to examine the odds
      ratio of pre/T2D in groups cross-classified by subjective and objective MVPA and 
      SED. Less than half of participants fell into concordant categories of MVPA and
      SED using subjective and objective measures, with 7.0-9.4% of participants in the
      extreme discordant categories of high-low or low-high subjective-objective MVPA
      or SED. Low objective MVPA, regardless of subjective MVPA status, was associated 
      with a higher prevalence of pre/T2D (P<0.05). When cross-classifying by MVPA and 
      SED, the majority of participants fell into concordant categories of MVPA-SED,
      with <4% of participants in the extreme discordant categories of MVPA-SED. Low
      objective MVPA, regardless of objective SED, was associated with a higher
      prevalence of pre/T2D (P<0.05). These findings suggest that low objectively
      measured MVPA appears more closely associated with pre/T2D risk compared to
      subjective measures, and there does not appear to be an additive effect of SED on
      pre/T2D risk after accounting for MVPA.

TI  - Zebrafish: A Model to Study and Understand the Diabetic Nephropathy and Other
      Microvascular Complications of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.
LID - 312 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/vetsci9070312 [doi]
AB  - Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a complicated metabolic illness that has had a
      worldwide impact and placed an unsustainable load on both developed and
      developing countries' health care systems. According to the International
      Diabetes Federation, roughly 537 million individuals had diabetes in 2021, with
      type 2 diabetes mellitus accounting for the majority of cases (T2DM). T2DM is a
      chronic illness defined by insufficient insulin production from pancreatic islet 
      cells. T2DM generates various micro and macrovascular problems, with diabetic
      nephropathy (DN) being one of the most serious microvascular consequences, and
      which can lead to end-stage renal disease. The zebrafish (Danio rerio) has set
      the way for its future as a disease model organism. As numerous essential
      developmental processes, such as glucose metabolism and reactive metabolite
      production pathways, have been identified in zebrafish that are comparable to
      those seen in humans, it is a good model for studying diabetes and its
      consequences. It also has many benefits over other vertebrate models, including
      the permeability of its embryos to small compounds, disease-driven therapeutic
      target selection, in vivo validation, and deconstruction of biological networks. 
      The organism can also be utilized to investigate and understand the genetic
      abnormalities linked to the onset of diabetes problems. Zebrafish may be used to 
      examine and visualize the growth, morphology, and function of organs under normal
      physiological and diabetic settings. The zebrafish has become one of the most
      useful models for studying DN, especially when combined with genetic alterations 
      and/or mutant or transgenic fish lines. The significant advancements of CRISPR
      and next-generation sequencing technology for disease modelling in zebrafish, as 
      well as developments in molecular and nano technologies, have advanced the
      understanding of the molecular mechanisms of several human diseases, including
      DN. In this review, we emphasize the physiological and pathological processes
      relating to microvascular problems in zebrafish, as well as the many experimental
      zebrafish models used to research DN, and the DN-related outcomes and mechanisms 
      observed in zebrafish.

TI  - A gut microbial peptide and molecular mimicry in the pathogenesis of type 1
      diabetes.
PG  - e2120028119
LID - 10.1073/pnas.2120028119 [doi]
AB  - Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease characterized by the destruction
      of pancreatic beta-cells. One of the earliest aspects of this process is the
      development of autoantibodies and T cells directed at an epitope in the B-chain
      of insulin (insB:9-23). Analysis of microbial protein sequences with homology to 
      the insB:9-23 sequence revealed 17 peptides showing >50% identity to insB:9-23.
      Of these 17 peptides, the hprt4-18 peptide, found in the normal human gut
      commensal Parabacteroides distasonis, activated both human T cell clones from T1D
      patients and T cell hybridomas from nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice specific to
      insB:9-23. Immunization of NOD mice with P. distasonis insB:9-23 peptide mimic or
      insB:9-23 peptide verified immune cross-reactivity. Colonization of female NOD
      mice with P. distasonis accelerated the development of T1D, increasing
      macrophages, dendritic cells, and destructive CD8(+) T cells, while decreasing
      FoxP3(+) regulatory T cells. Western blot analysis identified P.
      distasonis-reacting antibodies in sera of NOD mice colonized with P. distasonis
      and human T1D patients. Furthermore, adoptive transfer of splenocytes from P.
      distasonis-treated mice to NOD/SCID mice enhanced disease phenotype in the
      recipients. Finally, analysis of human children gut microbiome data from a
      longitudinal DIABIMMUNE study revealed that seroconversion rates (i.e., the
      proportion of individuals developing two or more autoantibodies) were
      consistently higher in children whose microbiome harbored sequences capable of
      producing the hprt4-18 peptide compared to individuals who did not harbor it.
      Taken together, these data demonstrate the potential role of a gut
      microbiota-derived insB:9-23-mimic peptide as a molecular trigger of T1D
      pathogenesis.

TI  - Diabetes, hepatitis C and human immunodeficiency virus influence hypertension
      risk differently in cohorts of haemophilia patients, veterans and the general
      population.
LID - 10.1111/hae.14637 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The reasons for the high prevalence of hypertension in persons with
      haemophilia (PWH) are poorly understood. AIM: To examine the roles of diabetes,
      Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) in the etiology of
      hypertension for PWH. METHODS: Retrospective cross-sectional design. Adult PWH (n
      = 691) were divided into two groups: (A) free of diabetes, HCV and HIV; (B) with 
      diabetes and/or HCV positivity and/or HIV positivity. Each group was matched by
      race and age with random samples from the general population of the US (National 
      Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys, NHANES) and outpatients at the Veterans
      Affairs Medical Center (VAMC) in San Diego. Generalized additive models (GAMs)
      were fitted for graphical analysis of hypertension risk over the lifespan.
      RESULTS: In Group A, PWH had the highest prevalence of hypertension compared to
      NHANES and VAMC, especially in young adults. In Group B, diabetes increased the
      risk of hypertension for all three cohorts (PWH, NHANES and VAMC), especially for
      PWH. In PWH, hypertension risk was also increased by HIV, in NHANES by HCV, and
      in VAMC by HCV and HIV. CONCLUSION: Diabetes conferred the greatest risk of
      hypertension for all three cohorts. However, curves of hypertension in relation
      to age revealed that diabetes, HCV and HIV modulated hypertension risk
      differently in PWH. PWH experienced a disproportionally high risk increase with
      diabetes. Therefore, haemophilia care should include screening for hypertension
      and diabetes at a young age.

TI  - A user preference analysis of commercial breath ketone sensors to inform the
      development of portable breath ketone sensors for diabetes management in young
      people.
PG  - e0269925
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0269925 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Portable breath ketone sensors may help people with Type 1 Diabetes
      Mellitus (T1DM) avoid episodes of diabetic ketoacidosis; however, the design
      features preferred by users have not been studied. We aimed to elucidate breath
      sensor design preferences of young people with T1DM (age 12 to 16) and their
      parents to inform the development of a breath ketone sensor prototype that would 
      best suit their diabetes management needs. RESEARCH DESIGNS AND METHODS: To
      elicit foundational experiences from which design preference ideas could be
      generated, two commercially available breath ketone sensors, designed for
      ketogenic diet monitoring, were explored over one week by ten young people with
      T1DM. Participants interacted with the breath ketone sensing devices, and
      undertook blood ketone testing, at least twice daily for five days to simulate
      use within a real life and ambulatory care setting. Semi-structured interviews
      were conducted post-testing with the ten young participants and their caregivers 
      (n = 10) to elicit preferences related to breath sensor design and use, and to
      inform the co-design of a breath ketone sensor prototype for use in T1DM
      self-management. We triangulated our data collection with key informant
      interviews with two diabetes educators working in pediatric care about their
      perspectives related to young people using breath ketone sensors. RESULTS:
      Participants acknowledged the non-invasiveness of breath sensors as compared to
      blood testing. Affordability, reliability and accuracy were identified as
      prerequisites for breath ketone sensors used for diabetes management. Design
      features valued by young people included portability, ease of use,
      sustainability, readability and suitability for use in public. The time required 
      to use breath sensors was similar to that for blood testing. The requirement to
      maintain a 10-second breath exhalation posed a challenge for users. Diabetes
      educators highlighted the ease of use of breath devices especially for young
      people who tended to under-test using blood ketone strips. CONCLUSIONS: Breath
      ketone sensors for diabetes management have potential that may facilitate ketone 
      testing in young people. Our study affirms features for young people that drive
      usability of breath sensors among this population, and provides a model of user
      preference assessment.

TI  - Poor glycemic control, cardiovascular disease risk factors and their clustering
      among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: A cross-sectional study from Nepal.
PG  - e0271888
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0271888 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the most common complication of
      diabetes mellitus (DM). To prevent morbidity and mortality among patients with
      type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), optimization of glycemic status and minimizing
      CVD risk factors is essential. As Nepal has limited data on these CVD risk
      parameters, we assessed the prevalence of poor glycemic control, CVD risk
      factors, and their clustering among patients with T2DM. METHODS: Using a
      cross-sectional study design, we collected data of 366 patients with T2DM. We
      applied a multistage cluster sampling technique and used the WHO STEPS tools.
      Binary logistic and Poisson regression was applied to calculate odds and
      prevalence ratio of clustering of risk factors, considering P< 0.05 statistically
      significant. RESULTS: The mean age of participants was 54.5+/-10.7 years and 208 
      (57%) were male. The prevalence of poor glycemic control was 66.4% (95% C.I:
      61.5-71.2). The prevalence of smoking, alcohol users, inadequate fruit and
      vegetables intake and physical inactivity were 18% (95% C.I:14 to 21.9), 14.8%
      (95% C.I:11.1 to 18.4), 98.1% (95% C.I: 96.7-99.4), and 9.8% (95% C.I:6.7-12.8), 
      respectively. Overall, 47.3% (95% C.I: 42.1-52.4) were overweight and obese, 59% 
      (95% C.I: 52.9-63) were hypertensive, and 68% (95% C.I: 63.2-72.7) had
      dyslipidemia. Clustering of two, three, four, five and more than five risk
      factors was 12.6%, 30%, 30%,19%, and 8.7%, respectively. Four or more risk
      factors clustering was significantly associated with gender, age, level of
      education, T2DM duration, and use of medication. Risk factors clustering was
      significantly higher among males and users of anti-diabetic medications with
      prevalence ratio of 1.14 (95% C.I:1.05-1.23) and 1.09 (95% C.I: 1.09-1.18)],
      respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of the patients with T2DM had poor
      glycemic control and CVD risk factors. Policies and programs focused on the
      prevention and better management of T2DM and CVD risk factors should be
      implemented to reduce mortality in Nepal.

TI  - Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter-2 Inhibitors-from the Treatment of Diabetes to
      Therapy of Chronic Heart Failure.
LID - 225 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/jcdd9070225 [doi]
AB  - Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are currently the second-line
      pharmacotherapy in type 2 diabetes, particularly through their effectiveness in
      reducing glycemia, but also due to their cardioprotective and nephroprotective
      effects. In light of surprisingly satisfactory results from large, randomized
      trials on gliflozins, SGLT2 received the highest recommendation (Class IA) with
      the highest level of evidence (A) in the treatment algorithm for HF with reduced 
      LVEF in recent ESC HF guidelines. This great breakthrough in the treatment of HF 
      is due to different mechanisms of action of gliflozins that are reported to be
      able to change the natural course of HF by reducing the risk of both
      hospitalization and death. They are recommended regardless of the patient's
      diabetes status. This review summarizes the up-to-date literature on their
      beneficial and pleiotropic impact on the cardiovascular system.

TI  - The Role of Epicardial Adipose Tissue in the Development of Atrial Fibrillation, 
      Coronary Artery Disease and Chronic Heart Failure in the Context of Obesity and
      Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: A Narrative Review.
LID - 217 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/jcdd9070217 [doi]
AB  - Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a significant burden globally and are
      especially prevalent in obese and/or diabetic populations. Epicardial adipose
      tissue (EAT) surrounding the heart has been implicated in the development of CVDs
      as EAT can shift from a protective to a maladaptive phenotype in diseased states.
      In diabetic and obese patients, an elevated EAT mass both secretes
      pro-fibrotic/pro-inflammatory adipokines and forms intramyocardial fibrofatty
      infiltrates. This narrative review considers the proposed pathophysiological
      roles of EAT in CVDs. Diabetes is associated with a disordered energy utilization
      in the heart, which promotes intramyocardial fat and structural remodeling.
      Fibrofatty infiltrates are associated with abnormal cardiomyocyte calcium
      handling and repolarization, increasing the probability of afterdepolarizations. 
      The inflammatory phenotype also promotes lateralization of connexin (Cx)
      proteins, undermining unidirectional conduction. These changes are associated
      with conduction heterogeneity, together creating a substrate for atrial
      fibrillation (AF). EAT is also strongly implicated in coronary artery disease
      (CAD); inflammatory adipokines from peri-vascular fat can modulate intra-luminal 
      homeostasis through an "outside-to-inside" mechanism. EAT is also a significant
      source of sympathetic neurotransmitters, which promote progressive diastolic
      dysfunction with eventual cardiac failure. Further investigations on the behavior
      of EAT in diabetic/obese patients with CVD could help elucidate the pathogenesis 
      and uncover potential therapeutic targets.

TI  - Insights into the Uses of Traditional Plants for Diabetes Nephropathy: A Review.
PG  - 2887-2902
LID - 10.3390/cimb44070199 [doi]
AB  - Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a serious kidney illness characterized by
      proteinuria, glomerular enlargement, reduced glomerular filtration, and renal
      fibrosis. DN is the most common cause of end-stage kidney disease, accounting for
      nearly one-third of all cases of diabetes worldwide. Hyperglycemia is a major
      factor in the onset and progression of diabetic nephropathy. Many contemporary
      medicines are derived from plants since they have therapeutic properties and are 
      relatively free of adverse effects. Glycosides, alkaloids, terpenoids, and
      flavonoids are among the few chemical compounds found in plants that are utilized
      to treat diabetic nephropathy. The purpose of this review was to consolidate
      information on the clinical and pharmacological evidence supporting the use of a 
      variety of medicinal plants to treat diabetic nephropathy.

TI  - Effect of a Comprehensive Telehealth Intervention vs Telemonitoring and Care
      Coordination in Patients With Persistently Poor Type 2 Diabetes Control: A
      Randomized Clinical Trial.
LID - 10.1001/jamainternmed.2022.2947 [doi]
AB  - Importance: Persistently poorly controlled type 2 diabetes (PPDM) is common and
      causes poor outcomes. Comprehensive telehealth interventions could help address
      PPDM, but effectiveness is uncertain, and barriers impede use in clinical
      practice. Objective: To address evidence gaps preventing use of comprehensive
      telehealth for PPDM by comparing a practical, comprehensive telehealth
      intervention to a simpler telehealth approach. Design, Setting, and Participants:
      This active-comparator, parallel-arm, randomized clinical trial was conducted in 
      2 Veterans Affairs health care systems. From December 2018 to January 2020, 1128 
      outpatients with PPDM were assessed for eligibility and 200 were randomized; PPDM
      was defined as maintenance of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level of 8.5% or higher for 
      1 year or longer despite engagement with clinic-based primary care and/or
      diabetes specialty care. Data analyses were preformed between March 2021 and May 
      2022. Interventions: Each 12-month intervention was nurse-delivered and used only
      clinical staffing/resources. The comprehensive telehealth group (n = 101)
      received telemonitoring, self-management support, diet/activity support,
      medication management, and depression support. Patients assigned to the simpler
      intervention (n = 99) received telemonitoring and care coordination. Main
      Outcomes and Measures: Primary (HbA1c) and secondary outcomes (diabetes distress,
      diabetes self-care, self-efficacy, body mass index, depression symptoms) were
      analyzed over 12 months using intent-to-treat linear mixed longitudinal models.
      Sensitivity analyses with multiple imputation and inclusion of clinical data
      examined the impact of missing HbA1c measurements. Adverse events and
      intervention costs were examined. Results: The population (n = 200) had a mean
      (SD) age of 57.8 (8.2) years; 45 (22.5%) were women, 144 (72.0%) were of Black
      race, and 11 (5.5%) were of Hispanic/Latinx ethnicity. From baseline to 12
      months, HbA1c change was -1.59% (10.17% to 8.58%) in the comprehensive telehealth
      group and -0.98% (10.17% to 9.19%) in the telemonitoring/care coordination group,
      for an estimated mean difference of -0.61% (95% CI, -1.12% to -0.11%; P = .02).
      Sensitivity analyses showed similar results. At 12 months, patients receiving
      comprehensive telehealth had significantly greater improvements in diabetes
      distress, diabetes self-care, and self-efficacy; no differences in body mass
      index or depression were seen. Adverse events were similar between groups.
      Comprehensive telehealth cost an additional $1519 per patient per year to
      deliver. Conclusions and Relevance: This randomized clinical trial found that
      compared with telemonitoring/care coordination, comprehensive telehealth improved
      multiple outcomes in patients with PPDM at a reasonable additional cost. This
      study supports consideration of comprehensive telehealth implementation for PPDM 
      in systems with appropriate infrastructure and may enhance the value of
      telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond. Trial Registration:
      ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03520413.
